The lawn was ruined, and to return it to its former state required a new crop of sod, long hours of work, and large expense. ¶ My neighbor's warning was central to my lawn's welfare.

Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid» (John 14:27). ...  ¶ Third,the gift of love. 'Master, which is the great commandment in the law?' queried the lawyer who spoke to Jesus. Came the prompt reply: «Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. ¶ This is the first and great commandment. ¶ And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself» (Matthew 22:36–39). ... ¶ Fourth,the gift of life — even immortality. Our Heavenly Father's plan contains the ultimate expressions of true love. All that we hold dear, even our families, our friends, our joy, our knowledge, our testimonies, would vanish were it not for our Father and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.

To have left the lamb there would have meant certain death, either by falling prey to the coyotes or by starvation because it was so young that it still needed milk. . . . My father gave the lamb to me, and I became its shepherd. ¶ For several weeks I warmed cow's milk in a baby's bottle and fed the lamb. We became fast friends. . . . It began to grow. My lamb and I would play on the lawn. Sometimes we would lie together on the grass and I would lay my head on its soft, woolly side and look up at the blue sky and the white billowing clouds. I did not lock my lamb up during the day. It would not run away. It soon learned to eat grass. I could call my lamb from anywhere in the yard by just imitating as best I could the bleating sound of a sheep. . . . ¶ One night there came a terrible storm. I forgot to put my lamb in the barn that night as I should have done. I went to bed. My little friend was frightened in the storm, and I could hear it bleating. I knew that I should help my pet, but I wanted to stay safe, warm, and dry in my bed. I didn't get up as I should have done. The next morning I went out to find my lamb dead. A dog had also heard its bleating cry and killed it. My heart was broken. I had not been a good shepherd or steward of that which my father had entrusted to me. My father said, «Son, couldn't I trust you to take care of just one lamb?» My father's remark hurt me more than losing my woolly friend. I resolved that day, as a little boy, that I would try never again to neglect my stewardship as a shepherd if I were ever placed in that position again. ¶ Not too many years thereafter I was called as a junior companion to a home teacher. There were times when it was so cold or stormy and I wanted to stay home and be comfortable, but in my mind's ear I could hear my little lamb bleating, and I knew I needed to be a good shepherd and go with my senior companion.
