<p>Feel free to adapt the schedule to account for Sundays when regular Church meetings are not held. For example, you could cover two weeks of outlines in one Sunday lesson when ward or stake conferences or temple dedications are held. You may also need to adapt the study schedule if in your area Easter and Christmas are observed on dates other than those listed in this resource.</p>

<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading>You Are a Teacher in the Church of Jesus Christ</heading>
<p>You have been called of God to teach His children in the Savior's way. You were set apart to this calling by the authority of His holy priesthood. Even if you are not an experienced teacher, as you live worthily, pray daily, and study the scriptures, Heavenly Father will grant you the influence and power of the Holy Ghost (see 2 Nephi 33:1).</p>
<p>Those entrusted to your care are God's children, and He knows what they need and how best to reach them. Through the Holy Ghost, you will be guided during your preparation and while you are teaching. He will reveal to you what you should say and what you should do.</p>
<p>The essential purpose of gospel learning is to change lives. Your goal as a teacher is to help those you teach do all they can to become converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ — a goal that extends far beyond class time. Invite those you teach to participate actively in their own learning of the principles and doctrine of Jesus Christ and act on what they learn. Encourage them to make their individual and family study outside of class the primary focus of their gospel learning. As they act in faith by studying as individuals and families, they will invite the Spirit into their lives and be blessed more deeply than by anything a teacher might do.</p>
<p>Teach only the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as found in the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets. Pure doctrine — eternal, unchanging truth taught by God and His servants — invites the Spirit and has the power to change lives.</p>
<p>The calling to teach is a sacred trust, and it is normal to feel overwhelmed at times. But remember that God called you, and He will never forsake you. This is the Lord's work, and as you serve "with all your heart, might, mind and strength" (D&amp;C 4:2), He will enlarge your capacities, gifts, and talents, and your service will bless the lives of those you teach.</p>

<heading>Using Come, Follow Me—For Sunday School</heading>
<heading>Preparing to Teach in Sunday School</heading>
<p>The home should be the center of gospel learning. This is true for you and for those you teach. As you prepare to teach, start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families is also an important part of your preparation. It will help you gain a deeper understanding of the doctrinal principles found in the scriptures. You will also be able to inspire and invite class members to use Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families to enhance their personal and family scripture study (for help in doing this, see "Ideas for Encouraging Personal and Family Study" in this resource). As you do, remember to be sensitive to class members whose family circumstances may not support regular family scripture study.</p>
<p>During your preparation, thoughts and impressions will come to you about the people you teach, how the principles in the scriptures will bless their lives, and how you can inspire them to discover those principles as they study the scriptures for themselves.</p>
<heading>Teaching Ideas</heading>
<p>As you are making your teaching plan, you might gain additional inspiration by exploring the outlines in this resource. Don't think of these ideas as step-by-step instructions but rather as suggestions to spark your own inspiration. You know your class members, and the Lord knows them too. He will inspire you with the best ways to help class members build on the gospel learning they are doing in their homes.</p>
<p>You have many other resources available as you prepare, including ideas in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families and Church magazines. For more information about these and other resources, see "Additional Resources."</p>
<heading>Some Things to Keep in Mind</heading>
<ul>
<li>The home is the best place for gospel learning. As a teacher, you have an important responsibility to support, encourage, and build upon gospel learning in the home.</li>
<li>Class members' conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ will deepen as they understand and apply true doctrine. Encourage them to record and act on the impressions they receive from the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li>Teaching is more than lecturing, but it is also more than simply leading a discussion. Part of your role is to encourage participation that edifies and is based on the scriptures.</li>
<li>Heavenly Father wants you to succeed as a teacher. He has provided many resources to help you succeed, including teacher council meetings. In these meetings you can counsel with other teachers about any challenges you might face. You can also discuss and practice principles of Christlike teaching.</li>
<li>People learn best when they have opportunities to teach. On occasion, consider allowing class members, including youth, to teach a part of the lesson. Base this decision on the needs and abilities of class members. If you do invite a class member to teach, take the time to help him or her prepare in advance by using the ideas found in this resource and in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. Remember that as the called teacher, you are responsible for what is taught in the class.</li>
<li>This resource includes outlines for every week of the year except for the two Sundays when general conference is held. On Sundays when Sunday School is not held because of stake conference or any other reason, families may continue reading the New Testament at home according to the schedule outlined. In order to keep your Sunday School class on schedule, you may choose to skip a lesson or combine two lessons. To avoid confusion, Sunday School presidents may wish to advise Sunday School teachers about these adjustments ahead of time.</li>
</ul>

<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading>Ideas for Encouraging Personal and Family Study</heading>
<p>Here are some ideas to help you encourage class members to study the word of God at home as individuals and as families. Be sensitive to the fact that not all class members can study the scriptures with their families (for example, some members live alone or in part-member families).</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite class members to share experiences they have had as they studied the scriptures at home. For example, you could ask them to share a verse from this week's reading that impressed them and to explain why they found it meaningful.</li>
<li>Ask class members to give examples of what they are doing to make personal or family scripture study more meaningful. (Some ideas can be found under "Ideas to Improve Your Personal Scripture Study" and "Ideas to Improve Your Family Scripture Study" in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.)</li>
<li>Invite class members to share how they have acted on impressions they received during a previous class or during their personal or family study of the scriptures.</li>
<li>Spend a few minutes showing class members some of the resources provided by the Church to help members study the gospel, such as the scripture study helps found at scriptures.lds.org; "Scripture Stories" found at children.lds.org; youth-focused content at youth.lds.org; seminary and institute manuals; and videos, audio recordings, and images (see medialibrary.lds.org). Many of these resources are also found in the Gospel Library app.</li>
<li>Spend a few minutes explaining how to use the Gospel Library app to study the scriptures, including how to mark verses and record impressions.</li>
<li>Invite one or more class members to share how they teach a specific gospel principle in their families.</li>
</ul>

<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading>A Pattern for Teaching</heading>
<p>In this resource, you will find the following pattern repeated in each outline: invite sharing, teach the doctrine, and encourage learning at home. In many cases, as you teach, the elements of this pattern may overlap or occur in a different order. For example, consider that sharing an opportunity to teach the doctrine, and teaching doctrine should involve invitations to share. Likewise, encouraging learning at home can happen throughout a class discussion. Allow this overlap to happen naturally, following the promptings of the Spirit to meet the needs of the people you teach.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>As part of every class, invite class members to share insights and experiences they had over the past week as they studied the scriptures as individuals and families and applied what they learned. Help class members see that their personal learning outside of class is important. Their individual conversion will come not only through Sunday learning but also through their daily experiences. When class members hear each other's experiences, they are more likely to be inspired to seek similar experiences on their own.</p>
<p>Not everyone will have read the chapters for each lesson, and even some who did read may not feel
comfortable sharing. Make sure all class members feel like a valued part of the class, whether or not they have something to share.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<p>You and your class members should focus on doctrine the eternal truths of the gospel — found in the assigned scripture passages. As you discuss doctrine from the scriptures, what verses, quotations, experiences, questions, and additional resources might you share? How might you use these resources to help class members discover and understand gospel principles? How can you encourage class members to record and act upon the thoughts and impressions they receive?</p>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>At the end of the lesson, take a moment to preview next week's discussion. Consider how to inspire class members to continue learning from the New Testament at home, both individually and with their families.</p>

<chapter type="lesson">
<heading>DECEMBER 31–JANUARY 6</heading>
<heading>We Are Responsible for Our Own Learning</heading>
<p>As you read and ponder the scripture passages in this outline, record the spiritual impressions you receive. This will invite the Spirit into your preparation.<i>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families</i>and the following ideas can help you inspire the people in your class to study the New Testament this year.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>One of your objectives as a teacher is to encourage class members to learn from the scriptures on their own and with their families. Hearing the experiences of others can inspire them to seek their own experiences. So, at the beginning of each class, ask class members to share scriptures from their study that inspired or impressed them.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>To truly learn from the Savior, we must accept His invitation, "Come, follow me."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying the New Testament is an opportunity not only to learn about the Savior and His doctrine but also to discover how to<i>follow</i>Him more perfectly. The account in Matthew 19:16–22 is a good way to introduce this theme (see also the video "Christ and the Rich Young Ruler" on LDS.org). You might ask class members to search this account for something they learn about becoming a disciple of Jesus Christ and share what they find. For another activity idea related to this principle, see this week's outline in<i>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.</i></li>
</ul>
<heading>Learning requires acting in faith.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you inspire your class members to take a more active role in their learning, rather than placing sole responsibility on the teacher? Here's an idea: Invite a class member to toss a soft object to you, while you make no effort to catch it. Use this activity to begin a discussion about the roles of learners and teachers in gospel learning. Elder David A. Bednar's statement about learning by faith, found in "Additional Resources," could help in this discussion.</li>
<li>To help class members understand that learning the gospel requires faith to act, you could divide them into groups and invite each group to read one of the following accounts: Mark 5:25–34; Luke 5:17–26; and John 9:1–7. What did the people in each account do to show their faith in the Savior? What actions can we take to learn the gospel and show our faith that the Lord will help us learn truth?</li>
<li>All class members have responsibility to invite the Spirit into the class. To help class members understand this, ask them to read Alma 1:26 and Doctrine and Covenants 50:13–22; 88:122–23 and share what teachers and students can do to invite the Spirit. It might be helpful to write their responses on the board under headings such as these: What the teacher can do and what the learners can do. Would it help to create a poster with the class members' responses that could be displayed for the next few weeks?</li>
</ul>
<heading>We need to know the truth for ourselves.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many passages in the New Testament teach principles that can guide our search for truth. Examples include Luke 11:9–13; John 5:39; 7:14–17; and 1 Corinthians 2:9–11. You could invite members of your class who read these passages in their personal study to share what they learned. Or you could read these passages as a class and invite class members to share how they gained their testimonies.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Seeking learning by faith will help us gain our own testimonies.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>No matter how long we have been in the Church, we all need to constantly strengthen our testimonies. To help class members identify truths that they need to know for themselves, you could write on strips of paper some scripture references that teach important truths, such as John 3:16–17; 1 Corinthians 15:22; Mosiah 3:13; Alma 7:11–13; and Doctrine and Covenants 135:3. Ask class members to read these scriptures, summarize the eternal truths they find, and discuss what they can do to gain a testimony of them. To make this activity more engaging for youth, consider hiding the strips of paper around the room and inviting youth to "seek for the truth."</li>
<li>Acts 17:10–12 describes Saints who searched the scriptures and gained their own witness of the truth. To encourage class members to follow their example, read these verses together and invite class members to share scripture passages that have strengthened their testimonies of the gospel.</li>
</ul>
<heading>How can we make our scripture study more meaningful?</heading>
<ul>
<li>Developing the habit of scripture study may be challenging for class members who feel that they don't have the necessary time, understanding, or skills. What can you do to help them be successful? You might start by discussing the story about the axmen in "Additional Resources." To help class members gain the confidence to study the scriptures, you could share information from "Ideas to Improve Your Personal Scripture Study" in<i>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families</i>. Perhaps you or other class members could share experiences with using some of these ideas or other meaningful experiences studying the scriptures. You could also select a chapter in the New Testament and try studying it as a class using some of these ideas.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to study Matthew 1 and Luke 1 at home in preparation for next week's discussion, you might ask this question: "Have you ever been asked to do something that seemed impossible?" These chapters illustrate the truth that "with God nothing shall be impossible" (Luke 1:37).</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Claiming spiritual knowledge for ourselves.</heading>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar explained: "I have observed a common characteristic among the instructors who have had the greatest influence in my life. They have helped me to seek learning by faith. They refused to give me easy answers to hard questions. In fact, they did not give me any answers at all. Rather, they pointed the way and helped me take the steps to find my own answers. . . . An answer given by another person usually is not remembered for very long, if remembered at all. But an answer we discover or obtain through the exercise of faith, typically, is retained for a lifetime. . . . Only in this way can a person move beyond relying upon the spiritual knowledge and experience of others and claim those blessings for himself or herself" ("Seek Learning by Faith," Ensign, Sept. 2007, 67).</p>
<heading>Making time for scripture study.</heading>
<p>Brother Tad R. Callister taught:
"Two axmen. . . held a contest to determine who could cut down more trees in a day. At sunrise the contest commenced. Every hour the smaller man wandered off into the forest for 10 minutes or so. Each time he did this, his opponent smiled and nodded, assured that he was forging ahead. The larger man never left his post, never stopped cutting, never took a break.
"When the day ended, the larger man was shocked to learn that his opponent, who seemingly wasted so much time, had cut many more trees than he. «How did you do it when you took so many breaks?» he asked.
"The winner replied, «Oh, I was sharpening my ax.»
"Every time we study the scriptures, we are sharpening our spiritual ax" ("The Joy of Learning," Ensign, Oct. 2016, 14).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Stay focused on doctrine.</b>Ensure that class discussions remain grounded in the scriptures and the teachings of the prophets. You can do this by asking questions like these: «What gospel truths do we learn from the comments we have heard?» or «Can someone share a scripture that relates to what we've discussed?» (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 20–21.)</p>
</chapter>
<chapter type="lesson">
<heading>JANUARY 7–13</heading>
<heading>Matthew 1; Luke 1</heading>
<heading>"Be It unto Me according to Thy Word"</heading>
<p>Before you read any additional study materials, read and ponder Matthew 1 and Luke 1, and record your spiritual impressions. Let the Spirit guide your preparation. Then explore the ideas in this outline and in<i>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.</i></p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Give class members a few minutes to review Matthew 1 or Luke 1, and invite them to share their as follows: favorite verse and explain what doctrinal truths they learned. You may find it helpful to briefly review the events in these chapters first to give some context to the verses shared.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 1:18–25; LUKE 1:5–80</heading>
<heading>Heavenly Father works through His faithful children to accomplish His purposes.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members are more likely to have meaningful experiences while studying the New Testament this year if they can draw lessons from the experiences of the people they read about. To help them do this, you could write the names of the people in Matthew 1 and Luke 1 on the board, along with scripture references about these individuals, as follows:
<ul>
<li>Mary (Luke 1:26–56)</li>
<li>Joseph (Matthew 1:18–25)</li>
<li>Elizabeth (Luke 1:5–7, 24–25, 40–45, 57–60)</li>
<li>Zacharias (Luke 1:5–23, 59–64</li>
</ul>
Invite class members to pick one person they would like to learn more about, read the listed verses, and share with someone in the class what they learn from that person's experience. What can we do to follow that person's faithful example?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Annunciation, by John Scott</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>To help class members think more deeply about Mary's character and role in the Father's plan, you could show the videos "An Angel Foretells Christ's Birth to Mary" and "Mary and Elisabeth Rejoice Together" (LDS.org) or read together Luke 1:26–38, 46–56, looking for things Mary said that reveal something about her character. What else do we learn about Mary? What can she teach us about accepting God's will for us?</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 1:5–25</heading>
<heading>God's blessings come in His own time.</heading>
<ul>
<li>There may be people in your class who, like Elisabeth and Zacharias, are living righteously and yet have not received a hoped-for blessing. How could you help them learn from the examples of Elisabeth and Zacharias? You could start by asking class members to write down blessings they are hoping for. Then they could search Luke 1:5–25, looking for lessons they can learn from Elisabeth and Zacharias about waiting on the Lord. They could also read and ponder the quotations in "Additional Resources." Encourage them to write what they learn next to the hoped-for blessing and, if appropriate, share their thoughts.</li>
<li>What other examples of waiting on the Lord's timing can class members share from their own lives or from accounts in the scriptures? What do we learn from these examples?</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 1:26–38</heading>
<heading>"With God nothing shall be impossible."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members may a times wonder — as Mary did — how God's plans for them or promises to them can be fulfilled. To help class members understand that through God's power all things are possible, you could display the picture The Annunciation: The Angel Gabriel Appears to Mary (Gospel Art Book, no. 28) and invite them to read together Luke 1:26–38. What can we learn about overcoming the seemingly impossible by studying Mary's words and actions? Ask class members to share experiences in which God helped them accomplish something they thought was impossible. For a modern example of Saints who with God's help accomplished something that seemed impossible, watch the video "Sealed Together: The Manaus Temple Caravan" (LDS.org).</li>
<li>The Savior's life demonstrated the truth that Gabriel declared: "With God nothing shall be impossible" (Luke 1:37). To illustrate this principle, you could ask class members to think of times when the Savior accomplished seemingly impossible things when doing His Father's will (see, for example, John 9:1–7). To help class members see how this principle operates in their lives, you could invite them to ponder questions like the following: What difference does it make in your life to know that nothing is impossible with God? How does it change the way you serve in the Church? the way you interact with your family? It may also help to compare Luke 1:37 with the Savior's words in Mark 14:36.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 1:18–25; LUKE 1:26–55</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>A main purpose of Matthew, Luke, and the other Gospel writers was to testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. How can you help class members recognize this purpose in the very first chapters they will read in the New Testament? Here is one idea: Divide the class into groups or pairs, and give each group a set of verses from Matthew 1 or Luke 1. Invite them to look for events or words that strengthen their faith in the divine mission of Jesus Christ as the Son of God and share with the class what they find. Some passages that you might suggest include Matthew 1:18–25 and Luke 1:26–38, 39–45, 46–55. Suggest to the class that as they study the New Testament this year, they might keep a list of passages that testify that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. You could even keep this list as a class.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read Matthew 2 and Luke 2 for next week's class, you could suggest that if they read the account of the Savior's birth prayerfully, they will gain new insights, even if they've read it many times before.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Matthew 1; Luke 1</heading>
<heading>Waiting on the Lord.</heading>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught, "Faith. . . includes trust in God's timing, for He has said, «All things must come to pass in their time.» (D&amp;C 64:32.)" ("Lest Ye Be Wearied and Faint in Your Minds," Ensign, May 1991, 90).</p>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:
"Every one of us is called to wait in our own way. We wait for answers to prayers. We wait for things which at the time may appear so right and so good to us that we can't possibly imagine why Heavenly Father would delay the answer.
"I remember when I was preparing to be trained as a fighter pilot. We spent a great deal of our preliminary military training in physical exercise. . . . We ran and we ran and we ran some more.
"As I was running I began to notice something that, frankly, troubled me. Time and again I was being passed by men who smoked, drank, and did all manner of things that were contrary to the gospel and, in particular, to the Word of Wisdom.
"I remember thinking, «Wait a minute! Aren't I supposed to be able to run and not be weary?» But I was weary, and I was overtaken by people who were definitely not following the Word of Wisdom. I confess, it troubled me at the time. I asked myself, was the promise true or was it not?
"The answer didn't come immediately. But eventually I learned that God's promises are not always fulfilled as quickly as or in the way we might hope; they come according to His timing and in His ways. Years later I could see clear evidence of the temporal blessings that come to those who obey the Word of Wisdom — in addition to the spiritual blessings that come immediately from obedience to any of God's laws" ("Continue in Patience," Ensign or Liahona, May 2010, 58).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Encourage class members to study the scriptures at home.</b>One way you can encourage scripture study at home is to provide time for class members to share discoveries and insights from their personal and family study. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 29.)</p>

<graphics-caption>Let Us Adore Him, by Dana Mario Wood</graphics-caption>
<heading>JANUARY 14–20</heading>
<heading>Luke 2; Matthew 2</heading>
<heading>We Have Come to Worship Him</heading>
<p>Before you read the ideas in this outline, study Luke 2 and Matthew 2, and record your spiritual impressions. This will help you receive revelation on how to best meet the needs of your class.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>How can you encourage class members to share insights and experiences they had as they studied these scriptures individually and with their families? Though they are likely familiar with the account of the Savior's birth, they can always gain new spiritual insights. Consider inviting a few class members to share a message they found in Luke 2 or Matthew 2 that impressed them in a new way.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>LUKE 2:1–38; MATTHEW 2:1–12</heading>
<heading>There are many witnesses of the birth of Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The firsthand accounts of worshippers in Luke 2 and Matthew 2 can help your class members ponder the ways they show their love for the Savior. Review the chart in this week's outline in<i>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families</i>. Some people in your class may have insights to share from this activity, or you could do the activity as a class. Why is it significant that these witnesses of Christ came from various walks of life? How can we follow their examples?</li>
<li>Before these witnesses worshipped the Christ child, they sought after Him. To help class members learn from their example, you could write on the board the following headings:<i>Shepherds, Anna, Simeon,</i>and<i>Wise Men.</i>Then invite class members to search Luke 2 and Matthew 2 and write on the board what these people did to seek the Savior. What do these accounts suggest about some of the ways we can seek Christ?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The shepherds became some of the first witnesses of the Savior's birth.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Would an object lesson inspire members of your class to make room in their lives for the Savior? Consider the following idea: Bring a jar to class and, after reviewing together Luke 2:7, ask class members to fill the jar with various objects that represent ways we spend our time. When the jar is full, invite someone to try to insert a picture of the Savior. What does this analogy suggest about making room for Christ in our lives? What can we do differently to make room for Him? The statement by President Thomas S. Monson in "Additional Resources" may help answer this question.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 2:13–23</heading>
<heading>Parents can receive revelation to protect their families.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One lesson from Joseph and Mary's flight into Egypt is that the Lord can give revelation to help parents protect their families from danger. To inspire discussion on this point, consider inviting class members to list on the board some of the dangers families face today. What do we learn from Matthew 2:13–23 about how to protect our families and ourselves from these dangers? How has personal revelation helped us protect our families or other loved ones from danger? What counsel have prophets and apostles given to help us protect our families?</li>
<li>As part of this discussion, you might invite class members to sing together "Home Can Be a Heaven on Earth," Hymns, no. 298, or another song about families. What does the song teach about what parents can do to live worthy of revelation to lead their families?</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 2:40–52</heading>
<heading>Even as a youth, Jesus was focused on doing His Father's will.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The story of Jesus teaching in the temple when He was only 12 years old can be especially powerful to youth who wonder about the contribution they can make to the work of God. You could divide the class into pairs to read Luke 2:40–52 together (see the insight from the Joseph Smith Translation found in Luke 2:46, footnote c). Each pair could take a few minutes to share with each other what inspires them about this account. What opportunities do we have to share what we know about the gospel? What experiences can we share?</li>
<li>If you are teaching adults, this account could be an opportunity to discuss how to help the youth achieve their potential. Someone could summarize the account in Luke 2:40–52, and the class could discuss how these events influence the way they see the youth of the Church. What opportunities can we give youth to participate in doing "[the] Father's business" as Jesus did? (Luke 2:49). When have we been astonished by a spiritual insight shared by a youth or child? These words from President Henry B. Eyring might add to this discussion: "When an Aaronic Priesthood holder speaks, . . . I always expect that I will hear the word of God. I am seldom disappointed and often amazed" ("That He May Become Strong Also," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 77).</li>
<li>What does Luke 2:40–52 teach us about what Jesus was like as a youth? The pattern for personal growth suggested in Luke 2:52 could inspire a discussion on what we are doing to become more like Christ.</li>
<li>You might suggest that class members ponder how they are increasing in wisdom (intellectually), stature (physically), favor with God (spiritually), and favor with others (socially). They could even set goals in one or more of these areas.</li>

<heading>The formula for seeking Christ.</heading>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson taught:
"The formula for finding Jesus has always been and ever will be the same —<i>the earnest and sincere prayer of a humble and pure heart.</i>
"Before we can successfully undertake a personal search for Jesus, we must first prepare time for him in our lives and room for him in our hearts. In these busy days there are many who have time for golf, time for shopping, time for work, time for play — but no time for Christ.
"Lovely homes dot the land and provide rooms for eating, rooms for sleeping, playrooms, sewing rooms, television rooms, but no room for Christ.
"Do we get a pang of conscience as we recall his own words: «The foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.» (Matt. 8:20.) Or do we flush with embarrassment when we remember, «And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.» (Luke 2:7.) No room. No room. No room. Ever has it been.
"As we undertake our personal search for Jesus, aided and guided by the principle of prayer, it is fundamental that we have a clear concept of him whom we seek. The shepherds of old sought Jesus the child. But we seek Jesus the Christ, our Older Brother, our Mediator with the Father, our Redeemer, the Author of our salvation; he who was in the beginning with the Father; he who took upon himself the sins of the world and so willingly died that we might forever live. This is the Jesus whom we seek" ("The Search for Jesus," Ensign, Dec. 1990, 4–5).</p>

<p>Before you read any additional materials, read and ponder John 1, and record the impressions you receive. This will invite the Spirit into your preparation.<i>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families</i>and the following ideas can help you inspire the people in your class to understand and apply the doctrine in this chapter.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To help class members share what they are learning, you might ask them to write questions, comments, or insights from their reading on strips of paper and put them into a container. Draw strips from the container to discuss as a class.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>JOHN 1:1–5</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ was "in the beginning with God."</heading>
<ul>
<li>John began his testimony of Christ by testifying of the Savior's roles before He was born. What did John teach about the premortal Christ? Why is it important to know Christ's premortal roles? It might help to write these questions on the board and ask class members to look for answers in John 1:1–5 (see also Joseph Smith Translation, John 1:1–5 [in the Bible appendix]) and in Elder James E. Talmage's statement in "Additional Resources." What other scripture references could class members share that teach more about the premortal Christ? (For examples, see "Jesus Christ, Antemortal Existence of" in the Topical Guide.) As a class, you could also review "The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles" (Ensign or Liahona, Apr. 2000, 2).</li>
<li>If you would like to use these verses to talk about the Lord's creations, you could read John 1:3 and show pictures that depict the beauty of the earth. You might show the video "Our Home" (lds.org/topics/environmental-stewardship-and-conservation). Invite class members to share how the Savior's creations help them feel His love.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 1:1–14</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is the Light.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Physical light can help us understand the symbolism of spiritual light. How could you illustrate this symbolism to your class? You could turn off the lights in the room and shine a flashlight to show the contrast between light and darkness. Then ask class members to find every instance of the word light in John 1:1–14, and invite them to share how the Savior and His gospel provide spiritual light in their lives. How have class members experienced His light? As part of this discussion, you might want them to read more about the Light of Christ in Doctrine and Covenants 84:45–46; 88:11–13, or you might refer them to "Light of Christ" in the Bible Dictionary. How can we be a light to the world?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Savior and His gospel provide spiritual light.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Because John 1:1–14 is written in symbolic language, it may be difficult to understand. One way to help class members understand John's testimony could be to invite them to make a list of repeated words and phrases in these verses and share what each one teaches us about the Savior.</li>
<li>Here is a way to engage class members in these verses: Display several pictures (including the one from this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families) that depict aspects of Jesus Christ's life and divine mission. Invite class members to search John 1:1–14, looking for words or phrases that could serve as titles for the pictures.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 1:35–51</heading>
<heading>We can gain our own witness of the Savior and then invite others to "come and see."</heading>
<ul>
<li>In John 1, the invitation to "come and see" appears twice (see verses 39, 46). We may not have the chance to see the Savior physically the way Andrew and Nathanael did, but we can respond to the same invitation. You might ask class members what they think it means to "come and see" in our day and to share their own experiences of gaining a testimony of the Savior.</li>
<li>To introduce a discussion about these verses, consider asking class members to share stories about how they have introduced the gospel of Jesus Christ to others. Who did they invite to "come and see"? What do we learn from Andrew and Philip about sharing our testimonies of Christ?</li>
<li>Sometimes people don't share the gospel because they find that doing so is intimidating or complicated. The accounts John 1:35–51 show that sharing the gospel can be simple and natural. You could ask class members to read these verses and discuss how they could use them to help someone who is nervous about sharing the gospel. They could use the quotation by Elder Neil L. Andersen in "Additional Resources" for ideas. (See also the video "Good Things to Share" on LDS.org.)</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to study Matthew 3; Mark 1; and Luke 3, you could ask them to think of someone they would like to help bring to Christ. Tell them that in these chapters they will read about a prophet whose mission it was to prepare people to receive the Savior.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>JOHN 1</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ was with the Father in the beginning.</heading>
<p>Elder James E. Talmage taught: "That the Word is Jesus Christ, who was with the Father in [the] beginning and who was Himself invested with the powers and rank of Godship, and that He came into the world and dwelt among men, are definitely affirmed. These statements are corroborated through a revelation given to Moses, in which he was permitted to see many of the creations of God, and to hear the voice of the Father with respect to the things that had been made: «And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth» [Moses 1:32, 33]" (Jesus the Christ, 3rd ed. [1916], 10).</p>
<heading>We can invite others to "come and see."</heading>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen taught:
"The Savior taught us how to share the gospel. I like the story of Andrew, who asked, «Master, where dwellest thou?» [John 1:38]. Jesus could have responded with the location of where He lived. But instead He said to Andrew, «Come and see» [John 1:39]. I like to think that the Savior was saying, «Come and see not only where I live but how I live. Come and see who I am. Come and feel the Spirit.» We don't know everything about that day, but we do know that when Andrew found his brother Simon, he declared, «We have found . . . the Christ» [John 1:41].
"To those who show an interest in our conversations, we can follow the Savior's example by inviting them to «come and see.» Some will accept our invitation, and others will not. We all know someone who has been invited several times before accepting an invitation to «come and see.» Let's also think about those who once were with us but who now we rarely see, inviting them to come back and see once more. . . .
"For those using the Internet and mobile phones, there are new ways to invite others to «come and see.» Let's make sharing our faith online more a part of our daily life" ("It's a Miracle," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 79).</p>
<heading>Music can teach us of Christ.</heading>
<p>Consider using the hymn "For the Beauty of the Earth," Hymns, no. 92, as you discuss the Savior's role as Creator (see John 1:3). You could also use the video of "For the Beauty of the Earth" on mormontabernaclechoir.org.</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Help learners liken the scriptures to themselves.</b>The same invitation Christ gave to His disciples — to come and see — can help those you teach desire to follow the Savior. Encourage learners to apply the principles found in the scriptures to their own lives and to invite others to do the same. (See 1 Nephi 19:23; Teaching in the Savior's Way, 21.)</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To help class members share how learning from the New Testament is blessing their lives, you could write the following question on the board:<i>What is something you did because of what you read in the New Testament this week?</i></p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 3:1–12; LUKE 3:2–18</heading>
<heading>Disciples prepare themselves and others to receive Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How do we prepare for the visit of an important guest? A question like this can help you introduce a discussion about how John the Baptist prepared people to receive Jesus Christ. You could then divide the class into three groups to read Matthew 3:1–6; Matthew 3:7–12; and Luke 3:10–15, looking for how John the Baptist prepared people to receive Jesus Christ into their lives. Let each group take turns sharing what they found.</li>
<li>Just as John the Baptist did, living prophets help us prepare to receive the Savior in our lives. To help class members make the connection between modern-day prophets and John the Baptist, you could review John the Baptist's teachings in Matthew 3:1–12 and Luke 3:2–18 and some counsel from the most recent general conference. How does obeying this prophetic counsel help us prepare to receive the Savior?</li>
<li>Joseph Smith Translation, Luke 3:4–11 (in the Bible appendix) provides insight into the mission of Jesus Christ beyond what is found in Luke 3:4–6. What do class members learn from these verses about the Savior and our need to repent?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>John the Baptist Preaching in the Wilderness, by Robert T. Barrett</graphics-caption>
<heading>LUKE 3:3–14</heading>
<heading>We need to bring forth "fruits worthy of repentance."</heading>
<ul>
<li>In Luke 3:8, John the Baptist taught the people that before they could be baptized, they needed to show "fruits," or evidence, of their repentance. How can you help class members recognize the evidence of their own repentance? You might ask them to search Luke 3:8–14 and look for what John considered "fruits" of repentance. They could also review Moroni 6:1–3 and Doctrine and Covenants 20:37. You might draw a fruit tree on the board and let class members label the fruit on the tree with the "fruits" of repentance they find. This could also be a good time to talk about what it means to truly repent. Point out that one way we can "make his paths straight" (Luke 3:4) is through repenting of any obstacles that would prevent the Spirit from reaching us.</li>
<li>Singing the hymn "More Holiness Give Me," Hymns, no. 131, can encourage discussion about how repentance can help us to become more like the Savior. For a music video of this hymn, see mormontabernaclechoir.org.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 3:13–17</heading>
<heading>We follow Jesus Christ when we are baptized and receive the Holy Ghost.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To review the story of Jesus Christ's baptism, try this idea: Ask class members how they could use Matthew 3:13–17 to teach someone, such as a child or someone of another faith, about baptism. (They could also use the picture in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.) What important elements of baptism would they emphasize? They could practice their ideas by teaching each other.</li>
<li>To help class members remember their own baptisms and reflect on the importance of living their baptismal covenants, you might invite them to read Matthew 3:13–17 and Elder Robert D. Hales's statement in "Additional Resources." Class members might enjoy sharing their feelings about their own baptisms and their baptismal covenants. They could also sing "Come, Follow Me," Hymns, no. 116.</li>
<li>John the Baptist taught that the Savior would baptize "with the Holy Ghost, and with fire" (Matthew 3:11). The baptism of fire happens when we are confirmed and we receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. Why must we have the gift of the Holy Ghost to progress in God's kingdom? What effect does the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost have on us? (see Alma 5:14). The video "Baptism of the Holy Ghost" (LDS.org) could help with this discussion.</li>
<li>Here is an activity that will help class members further discuss the doctrine of baptism. Write the following questions on the board and the scripture references on strips of paper. Invite class members to choose strips and then read each scripture as a class. Discuss which question is best answered by each scripture. Are there other scriptures or insights that could help answer these questions?
<ul>
<li>What do the scriptures teach about the necessity of baptism? (3 Nephi 11:38) What does baptism by immersion symbolize? (Romans 6:3–5)</li>
<li>How should my baptismal covenants change the way I live? (Mosiah 18:8–10)</li>
<li>Why don't we baptize infants? (Moroni 8:8–12)</li>
<li>Why is it important that baptism be performed by someone with authority, not just sincere intent? (Hebrews 5:4)</li>
<li>If I am already baptized into another church, why do I need to be baptized again? (D&amp;C 22:1–4)</li>
<li>Why must baptism be followed by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost? (John 3:5)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to study Matthew 4 and Luke 4–5 at home, invite them to think of a temptation they face, and tell them that these chapters will teach them what the Savior did when He faced temptations.</p>

<heading>Matthew 3; Mark 1; Luke 3</heading>
<heading>The meaning of our baptismal covenants.</heading>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales taught:
"When we understand our baptismal covenant and the gift of the Holy Ghost, it will change our lives and will establish our total allegiance to the kingdom of God. . . . Entering into the kingdom of God is so important that Jesus was baptized to show us «the straitness of the path» [2 Nephi 31:9]. . . .
"As we follow the example of Jesus, we, too, demonstrate that we will repent and be obedient in keeping the commandments of our Father in Heaven. We humble ourselves with a broken heart and a contrite spirit as we recognize our sins and seek forgiveness of our trespasses [see 3 Nephi 9:20]. We covenant that we are willing to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ and always remember Him. . . .
"By choosing to be in [God's] kingdom, we separate — not isolate — ourselves from the world. Our dress will be modest, our thoughts pure, our language clean. The movies and television we watch, the music we listen to, the books, magazines, and newspapers we read will be uplifting. We will choose friends who encourage our eternal goals, and we will treat others with kindness. We will shun the vices of immorality, gambling, tobacco, liquor, and illicit drugs. Our Sunday activities will reflect the commandment of God to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. We will follow the example of Jesus Christ in the way we treat others. We will live to be worthy to enter the house of the Lord" ("The Covenant of Baptism: To Be in the Kingdom and of the Kingdom," Ensign, Nov. 2000, 7–8).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Teach basic doctrine.</b>Hyrum Smith taught, "Preach the first principles of the Gospel — preach them over again; you will find that day after day new ideas and additional light concerning them will be revealed to you. You can enlarge upon them so as to comprehend them clearly. You will then be able to make them more plainly understood by those you teach" (Manuscript History of the Church, vol. E-1, p. 1994, josephsmithpapers.org).</p>

<p>This week's reading includes this statement: "They were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power" (Luke 4:32; see also Mark 1:22). What verses can class members share from these chapters that helped them feel that doctrinal power for themselves?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 4:1–11; LUKE 4:1–13</heading>
<heading>Heavenly Father has given us the power and means to resist temptation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The account of the Savior resisting Satan could help class members recognize ways in which Satan tries to tempt them. Class members could select one of the temptations in Matthew 4:1–11 or Luke 4:1–13 and think of a modern, related temptation (the statements in "Additional Resources" might help). Why is it helpful to know that the Savior faced temptations similar to those we face today? Why was Christ able to resist temptation? For other scriptural examples of people resisting Satan, see Genesis 39:7–20; 2 Nephi 4:16–35; and Moses 1:10–22.</li>
<li>One way to encourage discussion about Matthew 4:1–11 and Luke 4:1–13 could be to write two questions on the board:<i>What do we learn about Christ from this story?</i>and<i>What do we learn about Satan?</i>Then invite class members to search the passages to find answers to these questions and write their answers on the board.</li>
<li>What could help your class resist temptation? You could ask class members to review instances in Matthew 4:1–11 or Luke 4:1–13 in which the Savior's knowledge of the scriptures helped Him respond to Satan (by saying, "It is written"). Give class members time to find and share scriptures that could fortify and strengthen them when they feel tempted. (For ideas, they could look in the Topical Guide entry on "Temptation.")</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 4:16–30</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is the prophesied Messiah.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help your class members better understand this account, you might explain that the titles Messiah and Christ both mean "the anointed." As they read Luke 4:18–21, ask them to think about what it means to say that Jesus is the Christ, the Messiah, or the Anointed One. They may also find it helpful to read "Anointed One" in the Bible Dictionary. How does Jesus declare that He is the Messiah today? Invite class members to share how they came to know that Jesus Christ is their Savior.</li>
<li>There may be some helpful lessons to learn by exploring why the people of Nazareth did not accept Jesus as the prophesied Messiah. One way to do this could be to contrast their attitudes with those of the widow of Zarephath and Naaman in the Old Testament. You could contact some class members in advance and ask them to come prepared to summarize each of these accounts (see 1 Kings 17:8–24; 2 Kings 5:1–17; Luke 4:16–30). What do these accounts teach us about miracles and responding to God's servants? Do class members see any messages for today's Church members in the Savior's words to the people of Nazareth?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 4:18–22; LUKE 5:1–11</heading>
<heading>The commitment to follow Christ means accepting His will and forsaking our own.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes the direction the Lord gives us doesn't make sense at first. Class members could search Luke 5:1–11, looking for what the Savior asked of Peter and why Peter might have doubted His instructions. How might this experience have affected Peter's views about the Savior and himself? You could invite class members to share experiences in which they demonstrated their faith in divine guidance, despite not having a complete understanding. What was the result when they exercised their faith?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>"Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men" (Matthew 4:19).</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Just as the fishermen "forsook all" to follow Jesus Christ (Luke 5:11), there are things we have to forsake to become His disciples. What does Matthew 4:18–22 imply about the attitudes and faith of Peter, Andrew, James, and John? It might be helpful to bring a fishing net to class and invite class members to write down things they are willing to forsake or have already forsaken to follow Christ and place them in the net. Consider inviting a few class members to share how their lives have changed as they have chosen to forsake all to follow the Savior.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read John 2–4 during the coming week, you could ask them to ponder what they think it means to be "born again." Tell them that next week's reading will help them answer this question.</p>

<p>"Jesus Declares He Is the Messiah" (video, LDS.org).</p>
<heading>Types of temptation.</heading>
<p>After speaking of the types of temptation that the Savior faced in the wilderness, President David O. McKay taught:
"Every temptation that comes to you and me comes in one of three forms: 
"(1) A temptation of the appetite or passion;
"(2) A yielding to pride, fashion, or vanity;
"(3) A desire for worldly riches or power and dominion over lands or earthly possessions of men" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: David O. McKay [2003], 82).</p>
<p>Speaking of Jesus's experience in Matthew 4, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"<i>If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.'. . .</i>
"The temptation is not in the eating. . . . The temptation, at least the part I wish to focus on, is to do it<i>this way</i>, to get his bread — his physical satisfaction, relief for his human appetite — the easy way, by abuse of power and without a willingness to wait for the right time and the right way. . . .
"<i>If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down' from the pinnacle of this temple. . . .</i>
"The temptation here is even more subtle than the first. It is a temptation of the spirit, of a private hunger more real than the need for bread. Would God save him?. . . Why not get spiritual confirmation, obtain a loyal congregation, and answer this Imp who heckles — all with one appeal to God's power?. . .
"But Jesus refuses the temptation of the spirit. Denial and restraint are also part of divine preparation. . . . Even the Son of God must wait. The Redeemer who would never bestow cheap grace on others was not likely to ask for any himself. . . .
"<i>. . . 'All these things will I give thee, if thou will fall down and worship me.'</i>
"Satan. . . [asks], 'What is your price? Cheap bread you resist. Tawdry Messianic drama you resist, but no man can resist this world's wealth.<i>Name your price.'</i>Satan is proceeding under his first article of faithlessness — the unequivocal belief that you can buy anything in this world for money.
"Jesus will one day rule the world. He will govern every principality and power in it. He will be King of Kings and Lord of Lords. But<i>not this way</i>" ("The Inconvenient Messiah," Ensign, Feb. 1984, 68–71).</p>

<p>Write three headings on the board:<i>John 2, John 3,</i>and<i>John 4.</i>Give class members a few minutes to review these chapters, and then ask them to write under each heading a verse that helped them understand the doctrine and events in that chapter. Discuss the verses they wrote.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>JOHN 2:1–11</heading>
<heading>Our lives are changed as we follow Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes we can gain spiritual insights by paying attention to the details in a scriptural account. Consider inviting class members to read John 2:1–11 and list the details that deepen their appreciation of the miracle at the wedding feast. How did this miracle manifest the glory of God? (see verse 11).</li>
<li>It may help class members understand this story if they consider the miracle from the unique perspectives of those who witnessed it. How are our attitudes toward miracles sometimes like those of the people at the wedding feast — for example, like Mary, who knew a miracle could take place, or the ruler, who was unaware that a miracle had occurred? Consider inviting a few class members to give an account of the feast as if they were one of the people present.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 2:13–22</heading>
<heading>We can defend sacred places and things.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help class members learn from the account of Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple? How can they defend sacred places and things such as homes, churches, temples, and scriptures? This statement from President David O. McKay might help: "Make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.' (John 2:16.) Making and spending money, . . . faultfinding, and particularly gossiping about neighbors in a house of worship, are essentially violations of this command given nearly two thousand years ago" (in Conference Report, Oct. 1956, 7). How can we preserve the sanctity of the temple and other holy places?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 3:1–21</heading>
<heading>We must be born again to enter the kingdom of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members understand Jesus's invitation to be born again (see John 3:3), you could invite them to share insights they gain from what the Savior taught Nicodemus in these verses. What words and phrases did He use? What other scriptures or statements from Church leaders could expand class members' understanding of this invitation? (See Topical Guide, "Man, New, Spiritually Reborn" for scriptural examples; see "Additional Resources" for statements from Church leaders.)</li>
<li>How might class members explain to someone of another faith what it means to be born again? How would they include repentance, baptism, and confirmation in this conversation? Consider inviting class members to practice how they would answer this question with the person sitting next to them. The quote from the Prophet Joseph Smith in "Additional Resources" could add to this discussion.</li>
<li>Some people believe that a person can't really change; Nicodemus, however, is an example of someone who did change as a result of following the gospel of Jesus Christ. To help class members see this, you could invite them to search John 3:1–2; John 7:40–52; and John 19:39–40. What do we learn from these passages about Nicodemus's attitudes and beliefs? How did he change over time? What examples can we share about people we know who have changed because of the gospel?</li>
<li>Looking at a baby or picture of a baby may give your class a good opportunity to compare the qualities of a newborn with the qualities of someone who has been spiritually reborn.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 4:6–34</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ offers us living water and the "meat" of doing God's work.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Our bodies need food and water daily. Jesus referred to these universal needs when He taught both the Samaritan woman and His disciples. To help class members understand what the Savior was teaching, you could post pictures of food and water on the board and invite class members to write under each picture the spiritual truths that Jesus taught. How can worshipping God in spirit and in truth quench our spiritual thirst? How is our spiritual hunger satisfied by doing the will of God?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Jesus Christ offers us living water.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Reflecting on the progression of the Samaritan woman's testimony of Jesus Christ can help your class members ponder how they have come to know He is the Messiah. As a class, look for the terms the Samaritan woman use to refer to the Savior in John 4:6–30. What do these terms imply about her knowledge of who Jesus was? How have we grown in our testimonies that He is our Savior?</li>

<p>To inspire class members to read Matthew 5 and Luke 6, tell them that these chapters contain what President Joseph Fielding Smith called "the greatest [sermon] that was ever preached, so far as we know" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Fielding Smith [2013], 234).</p>

<heading>What it means to be born again.</heading>
<p>The Prophet Joseph Smith taught: "You might as well baptize a bag of sand as a man, if not done in view of the remission of sins and getting of the Holy Ghost. Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half — that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 95).</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar taught: "Conversion . . . is mighty, not minor — a spiritual rebirth and fundamental change of what we feel and desire, what we think and do, and what we are. Indeed, the essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through our reliance upon «the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah» (2 Nephi 2:8). As we choose to follow the Master, we choose to be changed — to be spiritually reborn" ("Ye Must Be Born Again," Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 20).</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught: "You may ask, Why doesn't this mighty change happen more quickly with me? You should remember that the remarkable examples of King Benjamin's people, Alma, and some others in scripture are just that — remarkable and not typical. For most of us, the changes are more gradual and occur over time. Being born again, unlike our physical birth, is more a process than an event. And engaging in that process is the central purpose of mortality" ("Born Again," Ensign or Liahona, May 2008, 78).</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks taught:
"We were born again when we entered into a covenant relationship with our Savior by being born of water and of the Spirit and by taking upon us the name of Jesus Christ. We can renew that rebirth each Sabbath when we partake of the sacrament.
"Latter-day Saints affirm that those who have been born again in this way are spiritually begotten sons and daughters of Jesus Christ (see Mosiah 5:7; 15:9–13; 27:25). Nevertheless, in order to realize the intended blessings of this born-again status, we must still keep our covenants and endure to the end. In the meantime, through the grace of God, we have been born again as new creatures with new spiritual parentage and the prospects of a glorious inheritance" ("Have You Been Saved?" Ensign, May 1998, 56).</p>

<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith said that the Sermon on the Mount is "the greatest [sermon] that was ever preached, so far as we know" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Fielding Smith [2013], 234). Why do class members feel that this is true? What can they share?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 5:1–12</heading>
<heading>Lasting happiness comes from living the way Jesus Christ taught and lived.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Savior's Sermon on the Mount, which was addressed primarily to His closest disciples, begins with statements known as the Beatitudes, in which blessed life — a life of lasting happiness. To begin a discussion about lasting happiness, you could ask class members to share what makes them happy. According to the Beatitudes, what did Jesus say makes a person "blessed," or eternally happy? How are Jesus's teachings different from other ways people try to find happiness?</li>
<li>To help class members understand terms like<i>pure in heart</i>or<i>peacemakers,</i>you could list some of the terms from verses 3–12 on the board. Then invite class members to suggest the opposite of each term and what they learn about each term by doing this. Ask class members to ponder what they could change in order to be the type of person described in these verses. What does 3 Nephi 12:3, 6 add to our understanding of Matthew 5:3, 6?</li>
<li>Another way to explore these verses is to invite each class member to study additional scriptures about one of the Beatitudes and share with the Christ invited us to rethink what it means to live a class what they learn. How does someone they know exemplify that principle?</li>
</ul>

<heading>MATTHEW 5:14–16</heading>
<heading>The Savior's disciples are to be the light of the world.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How do your class members feel when they read Jesus's statement that they are "the light of the world"? What does it mean to hide our light "under a bushel," and why might we be tempted to do this? The statement by Elder Robert D. Hales in "Additional Resources" might be encouraging. Who has been a "light" to your class members?</li>
<li>Think of a way to demonstrate Christ's teaching that we are lights to the world. Could you show a picture of a city lit up at night? Could you bring a flashlight and hide it under a basket? Why does the Savior compare His disciples to light? How can we use this understanding to be a light to others? (see D&amp;C 103:9–10). Class members could discuss or roleplay ways in which the light of the gospel can shine in their lives and bless others.</li>
<li>Some other scriptures that could add to your discussion about light include 3 Nephi 18:24; Doctrine and Covenants 50:24; 84:44–47; 88:50, 67; and 93:36–40. Class members might also enjoy singing hymns about light, such as "The Lord Is My Light" and "Lead, Kindly Light," Hymns, nos. 89, 97. What do these hymns and scriptures add to our understanding of Matthew 5:14–16?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 5:17–48</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ taught a higher law that can lead us toward perfection.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The situations described in Matthew 5 were specific to the Savior's day, but the principles He taught are universal. To help class members see the applications to their lives, invite them to select one of the following passages and think of a modern-day example that illustrates what the Savior was teaching: verses 21–24; 27–30; 33–37; 38–39; 40–42; and 43–44. They could do this individually or in groups and share their examples with the class.</li>
<li>Youth might enjoy a matching game that helps them see that the Savior's teachings found in Matthew 5:21–48 supersede the law of Moses. You could create one set of cards with phrases that begin "ye have heard" (describing the law of Moses) from Matthew 5:21–44. Create another set with phrases from the verses that begin "but I say" (describing Christ's higher law). Put both sets of cards facedown, and let a class member select one of the "ye have heard" cards, followed by one from the other set, looking for matches. Continue until class members have matched the Mosaic law with Christ's new teaching. For each match, discuss why the Savior's teaching is needed in our day.</li>
<li>How can you help class members see that the Savior's command to be "perfect" means, as President Russell M. Nelson explained, to be "complete" or "finished"? (Matthew 5:48; "Perfection Pending," Ensign, Nov. 1995, 86–88). Here's an idea: Cut a picture of Jesus into a puzzle, and invite class members to write on the back of each piece a teaching from Matthew 5 that they feel inspired to apply to their life. Let them work together to complete the puzzle. How does Jesus Christ's Atonement help us become "complete" or "finished"? (see Bible Dictionary, "Grace").</li>
<li>You might also invite class members to set a goal to act on a prompting they received while studying Matthew 5. Consider how you can follow up on this invitation in future lessons.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<ul>
<li>To inspire class members to read Matthew 6–7 during the coming week, you could tell them that President Harold B. Lee called the Sermon on the Mount "the constitution for a perfect life" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee [2000], 200).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Matthew 5; Luke 6</heading>
<heading>Being a light.</heading>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales taught: "Have you ever stopped to think that perhaps you are the light sent by Heavenly Father to lead another safely home or to be a beacon from a distance to show the way back to the straight and narrow path that leads to eternal life? Your light is a beacon and should never stop burning or mislead those who are looking for a way home" ("That Ye May Be the Children of Light" [Brigham Young University fireside, Nov. 3, 1996], 9; speeches.byu.edu).</p>
<heading>Seeking perfection.</heading>
<p>President Harold B. Lee taught: "Would you suppose the Savior was suggesting a goal that was not possible of attainment and thus mock us in our efforts to live to attain that perfectness? It is impossible for us here in mortality to come to that state of perfection of which the Master spoke, but in this life we lay the foundation on which we will build in eternity; therefore, we must make sure that our foundation is laid on truth, righteousness and faith" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee, 195).</p>
<p>President Joseph Fielding Smith said: "[Perfection] will not come all at once, but line upon line and precept upon precept, example upon example, and even then not as long as we live in this mortal life. . . . But here we lay the foundation. Here is where we are taught these simple truths of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, in this probationary state, to prepare us for that perfection. It is my duty, it is yours, to be better today than I was yesterday, and for you to be better today than you were yesterday, and better tomorrow than you were today" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Fielding Smith [2013], 234–35).</p>

<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 6–7</heading>
<heading>If we hear and act on the Lord's teachings, our lives will be built on a firm foundation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What specific teachings from Matthew 6–7 will be most beneficial to those you teach? Consider writing on the board several references from Matthew 6–7 that contain these teachings. Class members could select one of the references to study silently and then write on the board any spiritual truths they learn. How have these teachings influenced our lives?</li>
<li>The Savior concluded His sermon with a parable that might help your class better understand the importance of living by the Savior's teachings (see Matthew 7:24–27; see also Helaman 5:12). To visualize this parable, class members could work together to build a strong foundation using blocks, cups, or other materials and then test the strength of their foundations. Perhaps they could also label their building materials with things they can do to apply the Savior's teachings. How could doing these things help us withstand the storms of life?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 6:5–13</heading>
<heading>The Savior taught us how to pray.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying the Lord's Prayer might help class members identify how they can improve their own prayers by following the Lord's example. You could invite them to write on the board phrases from Matthew 6:9–13 (or Luke 11:1–4) that stand out to them. As we ponder the Savior's words, what do we learn about the attitudes we should have as we pray? What do we learn about the kinds of things we should pray for and about? It may be instructive for class members to paraphrase some of the Savior's phrases as things they might say in their own prayers. For instance, "Give us this day our daily bread" could be paraphrased as "Please help me in my efforts to provide for my family."</li>
<li>Those you teach may benefit from studying other examples of the Savior praying to His Father, such as Matthew 26:36–42 and John 17. You could invite class members to study some of these passages, searching for answers to questions like "What do we learn about prayer from the way the Savior prayed?" and "How can we make our prayers more like the Savior's?" For other exemplary prayers, see Enos 1:3–17; Alma 31:26–35; and 33:3–11.</li>
<li>Do you have any experiences you could share related to prayer? Sharing your experiences may encourage class members to do the same. President Thomas S. Monson shared several personal experiences related to prayer in his message "Consider the Blessings" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2012, 86–89). You might discuss principles from this message and from the quotations in "Additional Resources." The entry "Prayer" in the Bible Dictionary may also be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 7:7–11</heading>
<heading>Heavenly Father answers prayers.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members strengthen their faith that God will hear and answer their prayers, you could write ask, seek, and knock on the board. Then invite class members to search the scriptures for examples of people who "asked," "sought," and "knocked" (for examples, see 1 Nephi 11:1; Ether 2:18–3:6; Joseph Smith—History 1:11–17). What do we learn from these examples about obtaining answers to our prayers?</li>
<li>Some important context for Matthew 7:7–11 can be found in the Joseph Smith Translation of Matthew 7:12–17 (in the Bible appendix). In these verses, Jesus's disciples anticipated some reasons people might give for not seeking truth from Heavenly Father. You might ask class members to imagine they have a friend who is reluctant to seek guidance or blessings from the Lord. What might class members say to encourage this friend? How might they use the Savior's words in Matthew 7:7–11?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 7:15–20</heading>
<heading>We can identify true and false prophets by their fruits.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Members of your class have likely been exposed to false philosophies and other deceptions of the adversary, whether on the internet or from other sources. They may have also heard others criticize the Lord's servants. How can you help them understand how to discern false prophets and teachings from true ones? You could display several pieces of fruit and ask what we can assume about the trees they came Members of your class have likely been exposed to false philosophies and other deceptions of the adversary, whether on the internet or from other sources. They may have also heard others criticize the Lord's servants. How can you help them understand how to discern false prophets and teachings from true ones? You could display several pieces of fruit and ask what we can assume about the trees they came from. How does this exercise help us understand Matthew 7:15–20? You could also read together some recent messages from the living prophets. What "fruits," or outcomes, does following their counsel produce?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>We can know true prophets by their fruits.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 7:15–20 could help build class members' faith in the divine mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith. What are the fruits of the work Joseph Smith accomplished? For some ideas, see Elder Neil L. Andersen's message "Joseph Smith" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 28–31). How could we use the Savior's analogy in Matthew 7:15–20 to bear testimony to our friends and family about the Prophet Joseph?</li>

<heading>Stories about prayer.</heading>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer told of a family prayer his family had before he left on a trip to California. A veterinarian had told them that their cow would not live through the day. "Our little boy said our prayer. After he had asked Heavenly Father to «bless Daddy in his travels and bless us all,» he then started an earnest plea. He said, «Heavenly Father, please bless Bossy cow so that she will get to be all right.»
"In California, I told of the incident and said, 'He must learn that we do not get everything we pray for just that easily.
"There was a lesson to be learned, but it was I who learned it, not my son. When I returned Sunday night, Bossy had «got to be all right»" ("Prayer and Promptings," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 45).</p>
<p>Brother Mangal Dan Dipty, a member of the Church from India, said: "As a child I attended the German Lutheran church regularly. We would go to the mountains to pray together often. One rainy day, everyone in the prayer group was drenched, and one of the preachers offered a fervent prayer pleading with the Lord to stop the rain. To our amazement the rain stopped. That was the beginning of my faith in God and prayer" ("My Journey as a Pioneer from India," Ensign, July 2016, 67).</p>

<p><b>Don't be afraid of silence.</b>"Good questions take time to answer. They require pondering, searching, and inspiration.

<heading>Miracles occur according to God's will and our faith in Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Members of your class may have found powerful insights during their personal study of the miracles in these chapters (see the list of healings in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families). Consider inviting class members to share their insights with a partner or with the whole class.</li>
<li>To help class members understand the relationship between faith and miracles, you could read several of the miraculous healings from Matthew 8–9 and Mark 2; 5, looking for the faith of the person who was healed or the faith of others. (If you don't have time to discuss all of the miracles, ask class members which ones were most meaningful to them.) Some of these scriptures could enhance your discussion: Mormon 9:15–21; Ether 12:12–16; Moroni 7:27–37; and Doctrine and Covenants 35:8. What do the Savior's healings and these scriptures teach about faith and miracles? See also Bible Dictionary, "Miracles."</li>
<li>There may be people in your class who have faith and are seeking a miracle, but the miracle has not happened in the way they desire. What do the scriptures and our Church leaders teach about this? In an article titled "Accepting the Lord's Will and Timing," Elder David A. Bednar told about how he counseled a couple in this situation (Ensign, Aug. 2016, 31–35; see also 2 Corinthians 12:7–10; D&amp;C 42:43–52). Have class members seen blessings come into their lives or the lives of others when desired miracles did not occur?</li>
<li>When reading about the miracles in Matthew 8–9 and Mark 2; 5, some people may wonder if such things are possible today. Moroni described our day as a time when "it shall be said that miracles are done away," but he also promised that God is still a God of miracles, for God is "an unchangeable Being" (Mormon 8:26; 9:18–21; see also Moroni 7:27–29). How can you help your class members increase their faith in God's power to bless their lives? You might ask them to share examples of miracles they have witnessed. You might also consider sharing accounts of miracles from Church history (see "Additional Resources").</li>

<heading>Jesus Christ has power to bring peace in the midst of life's storms.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You may be aware of some of the challenges your class members are facing. Because we all have trials at some time in our lives, reviewing the account in Mark 4:35–41 can build class members' faith that the Savior can bring them peace. Give each person a piece of paper, and ask them to write on one side a trial they have experienced. On the other side, ask them to write something from Mark 4:35–41 that inspires them to turn to the Savior during their trials. Encourage class members to share what they wrote, if they feel comfortable doing so.</li>
<li>The hymn "Master, the Tempest Is Raging," Hymns, no. 105, is based on the story in Matthew 8:23–27 and Mark 4:35–41. Perhaps class members could find lyrics in the hymn that relate to phrases in the scriptures. You could also show a picture depicting the scene (see Gospel Art Book, no. 40) and discuss what moment the artist is depicting. What are other ways you could help class members understand the meaning and power of this miracle?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MARK 2:1–12</heading>
<heading>Rescuing those who are lost requires our unified efforts.</heading>

<li>The account of this miracle teaches the value of working together in unity to assist the Savior in rescuing those in spiritual or physical need. Elder Chi Hong (Sam) Wong's message "Rescue in Unity" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 14–16) can add to a discussion about this truth. Consider inviting a member of the class to come prepared to review the account from the scriptures and then share what Elder Wong taught. What can we learn from Mark 2:1–12 about the value of working in unity to rescue those in need? (see also Mark 3:24–25).</li>

<heading>The Prophet Joseph Smith healed the sick.</heading>
<p>In July 1839, a large number of Saints who had been driven out of Missouri were living in wagons, in tents, and on the ground near Commerce, Illinois. Many were very sick, and Joseph and Emma Smith were exhausted from trying to help them. Wilford Woodruff described what happened on July 22: "It was a day of God's power. There were many sick among the Saints on both sides of the [Mississippi] River, and Joseph went through the midst of them, taking them by the hand and in a loud voice commanding them in the name of Jesus Christ to arise from their beds and be made whole, and they leaped from their beds made whole by the power of God. . . . It was truly a time of rejoicing" (Wilford Woodruff, Journal, July 22, 1839, Church History Library).</p>
<heading>Elder Franklin D. Richards calmed a storm.</heading>
<p>Elder LeGrand Richards, a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, told of an experience from the life of his grandfather, Elder Franklin D. Richards, who in 1848 was the leader of a group of British Saints who were crossing the Atlantic Ocean to the United States: "The boat upon which [Elder Richards] was sailing was in great jeopardy [from a severe storm], so much so that the captain of the boat came to him and pleaded with him to intercede with the Lord in behalf of the boat and her passengers; and Grandfather, remembering that he had been promised that he should have power over the elements, walked out on the deck of the boat and raised his hands to high heaven and rebuked the sea and the waves, and they were immediately calmed" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1941, 84).</p>

<heading>MATTHEW 10</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Savior's commission to His Apostles can help us in our individual responsibilities. Class members may have had insights into this topic through their personal study; for example, there is an activity on this topic in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. Invite them to share what they learned or work in small groups to complete the activity in class. Invite class members to share experiences when they felt the Savior's power as they fulfilled their callings.</li>
<li>Another way for class members to review Matthew 10 is to search this chapter for something the Savior asked the Apostles to do and draw a picture representing that thing. They could share their drawings and what they learned about the commission of the Twelve Apostles.</li>
<li>How can studying the commission Christ gave to His Apostles in Matthew 10 help your class members understand the role of modern prophets and apostles? It might be helpful to compare the Savior's commission to the Twelve to the commission given to the first Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in this dispensation, found in "Additional Resources." How have class members been influenced by the ministry of the living Apostles? Bear your testimony of the divine calling of the living prophets and apostles, and invite class members to bear theirs.</li>
<li>To illustrate the fact that every priesthood holder can trace his authority back to the moment when Jesus ordained His Apostles, invite a priesthood holder to share his line of authority.</li>

<heading>MATTHEW 10:17–20</heading>
<heading>When we are in the Lord's service, He will inspire us with the words to say.</heading>
<ul>
<li>People sometimes feel nervous when teaching or talking with others about the gospel. But the Lord promised the disciples that He would help them know what to say. What do we need to do to receive the Lord's promised help for ourselves? Invite class members to read Matthew 10:19–20; Doctrine and Covenants 84:85; and 100:5–8 to find the answers to this question. When has the Holy Ghost helped you know what to say? You might share your experiences and invite class members to share their own.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 12:1–13; MARK 2:23–28</heading>
<heading>The Sabbath is a day to do good.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help keep the Sabbath day holy, the Pharisees had implemented strict rules and man-made traditions, which eventually clouded their understanding of the true purpose of the Sabbath. Would those you teach benefit from a discussion of why the Lord gave us the Sabbath day? You might invite class members to review the accounts in Matthew 12:1–13 and Mark 2:23–28 and share what the Savior taught about the Sabbath day (see also Joseph Smith Translation, Mark 2:26–27 [in the Bible appendix]). What additional insights about the Sabbath do we gain from Exodus 31:16–17; Isaiah 58:13–14; and Doctrine and Covenants 59:9–13? What traditions or rules might distract us from the real purpose of the Sabbath?</li>
<li>While the Pharisees emphasized numerous detailed rules regarding the Sabbath, the Savior taught a simple principle: "It is lawful to do well on the sabbath" (Matthew 12:12). Those who live by this principle often have little trouble keeping the Sabbath day holy. What other principles help class members keep the Sabbath day holy? Why is teaching principles more effective than setting rules in developing spiritual self-reliance? (see the statement by the Prophet Joseph Smith in "Additional Resources"). Are there other principles we can think of that help us obey God's commandments? For example, what principles could help parents inspire their children to obey the Word of Wisdom or do family history research?</li>
<li>President Russell M. Nelson's message "The Sabbath Is a Delight" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 129–32) and the videos with Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's counsel in "Additional Resources" might add to a discussion about the Sabbath day.</li>
<li>It might be helpful for class members to review "Sabbath Day Observance" in For the Strength of Youth. They could role-play how they might explain to someone not of our faith why they keep the Sabbath day holy.</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 7:36–50</heading>
<heading>As we are forgiven of our sins, our love for the Savior deepens.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What can we learn from the woman's example and the Savior's teachings in Luke 7:36–50 as we seek forgiveness for our own sins? How does repentance strengthen our relationship with Christ? How could we use this account to teach someone what it means to seek forgiveness?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>You might challenge class members to read the parables in Matthew 13 and Luke 8; 13 and prepare to share in next week's class an insight into a gospel principle they gained from one of the parables.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Matthew 10–12; Mark 2; Luke 7; 11</heading>
<heading>The blessings of Sabbath day observance.</heading>
<p>In a series of three videos, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland teaches about the blessings of observing the Sabbath day: "Upon My Holy Day — Getting Closer to God," "Upon My Holy Day — Honoring the Sabbath," and "Upon My Holy Day — Rest and Renewal" (LDS.org).</p>
<heading>A commission to latter-day Apostles.</heading>
<p>When some of the first members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in this dispensation were called, Oliver Cowdery gave them a commission similar to the one Jesus Christ gave in Matthew 10. He said:
"'You will have to combat all the prejudices of all nations. . . . I, therefore, warn you to cultivate great humility, for I know the pride of the human heart. Beware, lest the flatterers of the world lift you up. Beware lest your affections are captivated by worldly objects. Let your ministry be first. . . . [It] is necessary that you receive a testimony from Heaven for yourselves, so that you can bear testimony to the truth. . . .
"'. . . You are to bear this message to those who consider themselves wise. And such may persecute you; they may seek your life. The adversary has always sought the life of the servants of God. You are, therefore, to be prepared at all times to make a sacrifice of your lives, should God require them in the advancement and building up of His cause. . . .
"He then took them separately by the hand and said, «Do you with full purpose of heart take part in this ministry, to proclaim the gospel with all diligence with these your brethren, according to the tenor and intent of the charge you have received?» Each of which answered in the affirmative" (in Joseph Smith Papers, Documents, Volume 4: April 1834–September 1835, ed. Matthew C. Godfrey and others [2016], 243–44, 247; spelling and punctuation standardized).</p>
<heading>Teaching correct principles.</heading>
<p>Someone once asked the Prophet Joseph Smith how he was able to govern so many people in Nauvoo effectively. The Prophet explained, "I teach them correct principles, and they govern themselves" (see Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith [2007], 284).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Promise blessings.</b>When you extend invitations to act, testify to your learners that they will receive the blessings God has promised when they act with faith on His teachings. Blessings shouldn't be our primary motivation for obedience, but Heavenly Father desires to bless all His children. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 35.)</p>

<heading>"Who Hath Ears to Hear, Let Him Hear"</heading>
<p>As you read, think of questions members of your class may have as they try to understand the messages of the parables. What could be difficult to understand? How can your study prepare you to answer their questions?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Review with the class "Ideas to Improve Your Personal Scripture Study" in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. Invite class members to share methods they used to study Matthew 13 and Luke 8; 13.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 13:1–23</heading>
<heading>Our hearts must be prepared to receive the word of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help those you teach visualize the messages of the parable of the sower, you could bring some seeds, a pot of soil, and a pot of small rocks to class. Ask a class member to plant one seed in the soil and one in the rocks. Which seed will grow better, and why? How does this object lesson relate to the parable in Matthew 13:1–23? How can we prepare our hearts to receive the word of God?</li>
<li>How can you use the parable of the sower to inspire your class members to prepare their hearts to receive the word of God? You could write Disciples and Others on the board. Invite class members to read Matthew 13:10–17 and look for how the Savior described the differences between His disciples and others who heard His parables. Then ask class members to search verses 18–23, looking for what might cause our ears to become "dull of hearing" or our eyes to close to spiritual things. What direction are we receiving in our day from God and His servants? In what ways are we cultivating "good ground"? (verse 23).</li>
<li>You might invite a few class members to each come prepared to teach a section from Elder Dallin H. Oaks's message "The Parable of the Sower" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 32–35). What does his message add to our understanding of the parable?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 13:24–35, 44–53</heading>
<heading>Jesus's parables help us understand the growth, destiny, and value of His Church.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help class members understand the truths about the Church that were taught in Jesus's parables in Matthew 13? You could list a few of the parables on the board (see this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families and Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith, 293–303). Ask small groups of class members to study each parable and look for what they learn about the growth and destiny of the Church. One way to compile all of the thoughts from each group is to draw a large circle on the board and label it<i>Christ's Church</i>("the kingdom of heaven"). As each group shares, they could write something in the circle that they learned about the growth and destiny of the Church.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The kingdom of heaven is like a fisherman's net.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>What do we learn about the value of belonging to the Church from the parables of the treasure in the field and the pearl of great price, found in Matthew 13:44–46? Some members of your class (or people they know) may have made sacrifices — whether big or small — to become members of the Church. Invite class members to share sacrifices they have made or seen others make in order to belong to the Church. What blessings have come as a result? Consider sharing President Gordon B. Hinckley's story about the naval officer in "Additional Resources." Invite class members to ponder what they feel prompted to sacrifice for the Church.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 13:24–30, 37–43</heading>
<heading>At the end of the world, the Lord will gather the righteous and destroy the wicked.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help your class draw lessons from the parable of the wheat and the tares that will help them remain faithful Latter-day Saints? Start by inviting a class member to summarize the parable and its interpretation. It might also be helpful to display the picture of wheat and tares from this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. What are some lessons in this parable for our day? Why is it important to know that the Lord allows His Saints to "grow together" (Matthew 13:30) with the wicked until the time of the harvest? How can we keep our faith strong in this environment, when wickedness is all around us? Doctrine and Covenants 86 gives additional insights into the latter-day application of this parable.</li>
<li>The statement by Elder L. Tom Perry in "Additional Resources" suggests that the tares could represent "wicked and worldly ways" that infiltrate our lives. To help class members ponder how they can discern this type of spiritual tare, write on strips of paper several gospel truths and several false, worldly ideas or practices. Place the strips together in a container. Then ask class members to select a few and discuss which are truths and which are falsehoods. (Many of these truths and falsehoods are identified in general conference addresses; you could look there for ideas.) How can we follow Elder Perry's counsel to "nourish that which is good" in our lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<ul>
<li>You might mention that next week's reading tells of people who had followed Jesus but then "walked no more with him" (John 6:66). Tell class members they can find insights that could help them and others remain faithful to the Savior.</li>
</ul>

<heading>Matthew 13; Luke 8; 13</heading>
<heading>"It's true, isn't it?"</heading>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley shared an experience he had with a naval officer from Asia who had recently joined the Church:
"He was introduced to me just before he was to return to his native land. We spoke of [gospel truths], and then I said: «Your people are not Christians. What will happen when you return home a Christian and, more particularly, a Mormon Christian?»
"His face clouded, and he replied, «My family will be disappointed. They may cast me out and regard me as dead. As for my future and my career, all opportunity may be foreclosed against me.»
"I asked, «Are you willing to pay so great a price for the gospel?»
"His dark eyes, moistened by tears, shone . . . as he answered, «It's true, isn't it?»
"Ashamed at having asked the question, I responded, «Yes, it's true.»
"To which he replied, «Then what else matters?»" ("It's True, Isn't It?" Ensign, July 1993, 2).</p>
<heading>We should nourish the good.</heading>
<p>Elder L. Tom Perry taught: "That old enemy of all mankind has found as many devices as he can think of to scatter tares far and wide. He has found ways to have them penetrate even the sanctity of our own homes. The wicked and worldly ways have become so widespread there seems to be no real way of weeding them out. They come by wire and through the air into the very devices we have developed to educate and entertain us. The wheat and the tares have grown close together. A steward managing the field must, with all his or her power, nourish that which is good and make it so strong and beautiful the tares will have no appeal either to the eye or the ear" ("Finding Lasting Peace and Building Eternal Families," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 44).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Center your teaching on doctrine.</b>Make sure your class discussions focus on the foundational doctrine in the scriptures. You can do this by asking students to read scriptures in advance, centering your class discussions on the scriptures, and asking class members to share their testimonies of true doctrine.

<p>As you prepare to teach from Matthew 14–15; Mark 6–7; and John 5–6, look for messages that are relevant to your class. As you do, consider how to engage class members in a meaningful experience with the scriptures.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>One way to begin a discussion of these chapters is to invite a few class members to each select a chapter from the reading and come prepared to share a message from that chapter that was meaningful to them. As they share, other class members could ask questions or add insights.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>JOHN 5:16–47</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is the Beloved Son of Heavenly Father.</heading>
<ul>
<li>In John 5, Jesus provided several insights about Himself, His Father, and His relationship to the Father. To help the class discover these insights, try dividing them into groups and giving them a few minutes to list as many truths as they can find in verses 16–47 about the character of God, Jesus Christ, and Their relationship. Invite the groups to take turns reading truths from their lists until every truth on each list has been shared. How do these truths help us better understand our Heavenly Father and His Son? How can we follow Jesus Christ's example of obedience to the Father?</li>
<li>An activity in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families invites learners to note every time Jesus used the word Father in John 5. Invite a few class members to share what they learned as they completed the activity. What insights did they gain about Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son? What does the restored gospel teach that helps us better understand who our Father is and why we worship Him? Some ideas can be found in the Bible Dictionary entry for "God" and in the entry "God the Father" in True to the Faith, 74–76. As part of this discussion, you might sing, listen to, or read "O My Father," Hymns, no. 292, as a class.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 14:16–21; MARK 6:33–44; JOHN 6:5–14</heading>
<heading>The Savior can magnify our offering to accomplish His purposes.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What could help class members find personal meaning in the miracle of Jesus feeding the five thousand? You might ask how reading about the miracle increases their faith in the Savior's ability to bless them personally. Have they ever felt that their means or abilities were insufficient to accomplish a goal or a commandment from God? Have they ever felt that the Savior magnified or multiplied their efforts to help them accomplish something that seemed impossible?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>The video "The Feeding of the 5,000" (LDS.org) may help class members ponder the miracle described in these passages. What details can we find in this account that increase our faith in the Savior? In what ways can the Savior feed us spiritually? When have we been fed and sustained by Jesus Christ? For an example of a miracle in our day that is similar to the miracle of the loaves and fishes, see the video "Pure and Simple Faith" (LDS.org) or Paul Van Den Berghe, "Power in Prayer," New Era, July 2012, 34–36.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 14:22–33</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ invites us to set aside our fears and doubts so that we can more fully come unto Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The account in Matthew 14:22–33 can help class members increase their faith in the Savior and their desire to follow Him. Invite class members to read this account, paying special attention to the words spoken by Christ, Peter, and the other Apostles. How might Jesus's words have helped Peter have faith to leave the boat and walk on the water? How do Jesus's admonitions to "be of good cheer" and "be not afraid" (verse 27) apply to us today? What can we learn from Peter about what it means to be a disciple of Jesus Christ and to trust Him?</li>
<li>Matthew 14:22–33 contains words and phrases that could inspire class members to exercise greater faith in the Savior. Ask them to search for such inspiring words and phrases, write them on the board, and discuss what they wrote. Can class members relate to Peter's experience? You might encourage them to think about and share experiences in which they, like Peter, took action to follow the Savior, even when the outcome was uncertain. What did they learn from the experience? How has Jesus Christ come to their rescue in their moments of fear or doubt?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 6:22–71</heading>
<heading>As disciples of Christ, we must be willing to believe and accept the truth even when it is hard to do.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The events in John 6 can provide a helpful perspective when people question the doctrine, history, or policies of Christ's Church. In this chapter, some of Jesus's followers refused to accept His teachings that He was the Living Bread and that they could be saved only through His sacrifice of flesh and blood. To help your class members apply this account to their lives, you could write questions like the following on the board and ask class members to look for answers in verses 22–71: What were the people expecting? (see verse 26). What did Christ offer them instead? (see verse 51). What did the people misunderstand? (see verses 41–42, 52). What are some ways we can choose to walk with Christ even when we have questions? Invite them to ponder the Savior's question and Peter's response in verses 67–69. What are some doctrines, ordinances, or other "words of eternal life" that can be found only in Christ's restored Church? Invite class members to share how these doctrines and ordinances have blessed them and their families. For insights from a modern-day Apostle, invite a class member to read Elder M. Russell Ballard's statement in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Class members may feel inspired to read the passages for next week's class if you point out that the events they read about could enrich their experience listening to general conference. Encourage them to come to the next class ready to share their insights.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Matthew 14–15; Mark 6–7; John 5–6</heading>
<heading>"Will ye also go away?"</heading>
<p>After quoting John 6:68–69, Elder M. Russell Ballard taught:
"For some, Christ's invitation to believe and remain continues to be hard — or difficult to accept. Some disciples struggle to understand a specific Church policy or teaching. Others find concerns in our history or in the imperfections of some members and leaders, past and present. Still others find it difficult to live a religion that requires so much. Finally, some have become «weary in well-doing» [D&amp;C 64:33]. For these and other reasons, some Church members vacillate in their faith, wondering if perhaps they should follow those who «went back, and walked no more» with Jesus.
"If any one of you is faltering in your faith, I ask you the same question that Peter asked: 'To whom shall [you] go?'. . .
". . . Before you make that spiritually perilous choice to leave, I encourage you to stop and think carefully before giving up whatever it was that brought you to your testimony of the restored Church of Jesus Christ in the first place. Stop and think about what you have felt here and why you felt it. Think about the times when the Holy Ghost has borne witness to you of eternal truth" ("To Whom Shall We Go?" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 90–91).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Listen.</b>"Listening is an act of love. . . . Ask Heavenly Father to help you understand what your class members say. As you pay careful attention to their spoken and unspoken messages, you will come to better understand their needs, their concerns, and their desires" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 34).</p>

For example, how did their study of these chapters influence their experience with general conference?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 16:13–17</heading>
<heading>A testimony of Jesus Christ comes by revelation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Have any of your class members had to explain to someone how they know the gospel is true? In Matthew 16:13–17, what did the Savior teach about how we receive a testimony? You could share how Alma gained his testimony (see Alma 5:45–46) or what the Lord taught Oliver Cowdery about revelation (see D&amp;C 6:14–15, 22–23; 8:2–3). What do you think Peter or Alma or Oliver Cowdery might have said if someone asked them how they know the gospel is true?</li>
<li>There may be people in your class who are praying for personal revelation but do not know how to recognize it when it comes. Elder David A. Bednar used two common experiences with light to teach about how we receive revelation; you may want to share Elder Bednar's insights with class members (see "The Spirit of Revelation," Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 87–90; see also the video "Patterns of Light: Spirit of Revelation" on LDS.org). What other scripture teachings or accounts can your class think of that would help someone recognize personal revelation? (For example, see 1 Kings 19:11–12; Galatians 5:22–23; Enos 1:1–8; D&amp;C 8:2–3.)</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 16:13–19; 17:1–9</heading>
<heading>Priesthood keys are essential for our salvation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To start a discussion about priesthood keys, you could write questions like the following on the board:<i>What are priesthood keys? Who holds the keys? How are priesthood keys given?</i>You might also share some scripture references that help answer these questions, such as Matthew 16:19; Doctrine and Covenants 107:18–19; 128:8–11; 132:18–19, 59; and Joseph Smith—History 1:72. Class members can find additional help by referring to Handbook 2: Administering the Church (2010), 2.1.1; Elder Neil L. Andersen's message "Power in the Priesthood" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 92–95); or True to the Faith, 126–27. Allow class members time to research a question of their choice. They could then teach each other what they learned.</li>
<li>A discussion about Peter and the other Apostles receiving priesthood keys on the Mount of Transfiguration can help class members strengthen their testimonies of the restoration of priesthood keys in the latter days. To inspire such a discussion, you could ask half of the class to study Matthew 17:1–9 (see also this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families) and the other half to study Doctrine and Covenants 110. They could then share with each other what they learned and note similarities between the two accounts. The video "Priesthood Keys: The Restoration of Priesthood Keys" (LDS.org) could also be helpful.</li>
<li>Do members of your class understand how priesthood keys bless their lives? To help them, you might invite them to search Handbook 2, 2.1.1, for a list of people who hold keys. Who are these people in your ward and stake? Maybe you could list their names on the board or invite some of them to talk to the class. How do they exercise the priesthood keys given to them to direct the work of the priesthood within their callings? How are we blessed by the service of these priesthood leaders?</li>

<li>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland used the account of a father seeking healing for his son to teach how we should approach the Lord when we feel that our faith is insufficient (see "Lord, I Believe," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 93–95). Three main points from his address are included in "Additional Resources." Perhaps you could divide the class into four groups and assign one group to discuss Mark 9:14–30 and each of the other groups to discuss one of Elder Holland's three observations. They could look for messages in this scripture account that can help us increase our faith. Perhaps you could divide the class into four groups and assign one group to discuss Mark 9:14–30 and each of the other groups to discuss one of Elder Holland's three observations.

<heading>Auxiliary presidencies receive delegated authority.</heading>
<p>"All ward and stake auxiliary organizations operate under the direction of the bishop or stake president, who holds the keys to preside. Auxiliary presidents and their counselors do not receive keys. They receive delegated authority to function in their callings" (Handbook 2, 2.1.1).</p>
<heading>Three observations to help us gain more faith.</heading>
<p>After retelling the account found in Mark 9:14–29, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"Observation number one regarding this account is that when facing the challenge of faith, the father asserts his strength first and only then acknowledges his limitation. His initial declaration is affirmative and without hesitation: «Lord, I believe.» I would say to all who wish for more faith, remember this man! In moments of fear or doubt or troubling times, hold the ground you have already won, even if that ground is limited. . . .<i>Hold fast to what you already know and stand strong until additional knowledge comes.</i>. . . The size of your faith or the degree of your knowledge is not the issue it is the integrity you demonstrate toward the faith you do have and the truth you already know.
"The second observation is a variation of the first. When problems come and questions arise, do not start your quest for faith by saying how much you do<i>not</i>have, leading as it were with your «unbelief.» . . . I am not asking you to pretend to faith you do not have. I<i>am</i>asking you to be true to the faith you<i>do</i>have. . . . Be as candid about your questions as you need to be; life is full of them on one subject or another. But if you and your family want to be healed, don't let those questions stand in the way of faith working its miracle. . . .
"Last observation: When doubt or difficulty come, do not be afraid to ask for help. If we want it as humbly and honestly as this father did, we can get it. The scriptures phrase such earnest desire as being of «real intent,» pursued «with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God» [2 Nephi 31:13]. I testify that in response to that kind of importuning, God will send help from both sides of the veil to strengthen our belief" ("Lord, I Believe," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 93–94).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Ask questions that invite testimony.</b>Asking questions that encourage class members to bear their testimonies can be an effective way to invite the Spirit. For example, when discussing Matthew 16:13–17, you could ask, "What have you learned about the Savior that has strengthened your testimony of Him as the Savior?" (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 32.)</p>

<heading>Easter</heading>
<heading>"O Grave, Where Is Thy Victory?"</heading>
<p>As you prepare to teach this week, consider how your class's discussion on Easter Sunday can build faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Ask class members how they would respond to questions like "What is the Atonement of Jesus Christ?" and "How can I receive the blessings of Christ's Atonement?" Did they read any scriptures this week that help to answer these questions?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ delivers us from sin and death, strengthens us in our weaknesses, and comforts us in our trials.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Do your class members understand that in addition to overcoming sin and death, Jesus Christ can also comfort us in our trials and strengthen us in our weaknesses? One way to help them discover these principles could be to write these words on the board: Sin, Death, Trials, Weaknesses. Ask each class member to read one of the scriptures listed in "Additional Resources" and ponder how the Savior helps us overcome or endure these things. Class members could write what they learn from these scriptures under each heading and share their testimony of the Savior and His Atonement.</li>
<li>What do the scriptures teach about the price Jesus Christ paid for our salvation? For example, see Luke 22:39–44; Mosiah 3:7; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19. What price did our Heavenly Father pay? (see John 3:16).</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Crucifixion of Christ, by Louise Parker</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Before class, consider inviting a few class members to bring a quotation from a conference message that describes how the Savior blesses us through His Atonement (for some examples, see "Additional Resources"). How do the teachings of modern-day prophets expand our understanding of the blessings of the Savior's Atonement? How do they strengthen our testimonies of the power of His Atonement?</li>
<li>Perhaps a simple object lesson could help illustrate the difference between being cleansed from sin and being perfected: You could write on the board the first few lines from Moroni 10:32, but include spelling or grammatical errors. Then invite a class member to erase the errors. Did this solve the problem? What lessons do we learn from this scripture and this object lesson about the effect the Atonement can have on us? This statement from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf might also help: "If salvation means only erasing our mistakes and sins, then salvation — as wonderful as it is — does not fulfill the Father's aspirations for us. His aim is much higher: He wants His sons and daughters to become like Him" ("The Gift of Grace," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 108).</li>
<li>Stories and analogies can help us understand Christ's Atonement. For instance, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shares a story about two brothers climbing a canyon wall in his message "Where Justice, Love, and Mercy Meet" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 104–6). There is also a video of the same title on LDS.org. Or you could watch together "Handel's Messiah: Debtor's Prison" (LDS.org; see description in "Additional Resources") and discuss how Jesus Christ's Atonement frees us from our prisons.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Witnesses in the New Testament bore testimony that Jesus Christ conquered death.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Consider reviewing the scriptural account of the first Easter — the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. You could invite a class member to retell the story in his or her own words (see John 20:1–17). You could also show a Bible video, such as "He Is Risen" (LDS.org).</li>
<li>Perhaps your class would gain deeper understanding of the importance of the witnesses of Jesus Christ's Resurrection if they imagine they are lawyers or news reporters investigating the claim that Christ was resurrected. Invite them to find people in the scriptures who could serve as witnesses (see Matthew 28:1–10; Luke 24:13–35; John 20:19–29; 1 Corinthians 15:3–8, 55–58). They could even write a brief summary of what these people might say when testifying in court or when being interviewed for a news report.</li>
<li>One way to deepen our appreciation for the Savior's Resurrection is to think about how we would explain our beliefs to others. How would class members share their testimonies of Jesus Christ in the following situations: a family member has been diagnosed with a serious illness; a friend has lost a loved one; a neighbor asks why you celebrate Easter. Encourage them to refer to the scriptures (such as those in "Additional Resources") as they plan their responses. Invite a few class members to share their thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Jesus Christ gives us hope and joy.</heading>
<ul>
<li>We can all have hope and be of good cheer because of the Savior. You might read John 16:33 and discuss how the Atonement of Jesus Christ helps us be joyful despite our trials. How have we received joy and been supported during our trials?</li>
<li>Reading Peter's testimony in 1 Peter 1:3–11 could give class members increased hope in the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Give them time to ponder these verses and work in pairs to find other scriptures that also describe how to obtain hope in Jesus Christ (see Topical Guide, "Hope"). They could use the scriptures they find to make a poster to display in their homes or online (see examples of inspirational picture quotes on LDS.org). Class members could consider the circumstances of family members or friends who may need to feel more hopeful.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>What would inspire class members to read Matthew 18 and Luke 10? You might tell them that these chapters contain two of the Savior's most memorable parables, both of which convey important lessons about how we should treat one another.</p>

<p>In 1741, George Frideric Handel composed an oratorio about Jesus Christ titled Messiah. Handel determined that the proceeds of a performance of Messiah would be donated to pay for the release of debtors from debtor's prison. Over 140 people who had been jailed because they were unable to pay their debts were set free as a result. Commenting on this event, President Russell M. Nelson said, "Without the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we would all be hopelessly indebted, just as were those people in debtor's prison. Our Redeemer, the Lord Jesus Christ, came to pay a debt He didn't owe because we owed a debt we couldn't pay." For a video depiction of this event, see "Handel's Messiah: Debtor's Prison" on LDS.org.</p>

<p>These chapters contain many examples of gospel teachings that are different from what the world teaches us. What truths did class members find in these chapters that are hard for some people to accept or live?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 18:21–35</heading>
<heading>We must forgive others if we are to receive forgiveness from the Lord.</heading>
<ul>
<li>At one time or another, we all need to forgive someone who has offended us. How could you use the parable of the unmerciful servant to inspire class members to be more forgiving? Perhaps you could write questions like the following on the board and invite class members to ponder them as one person retells the parable: Who does the king represent? Who does the unmerciful servant represent? What does his debt represent? Who does the fellowservant represent? What does his debt represent? The information about talents and pence in "Additional Resources" can give class members an idea of how vastly different the two debts in the parable are. Invite class members to ponder what messages the parable has for them personally.</li>
<li>You could invite the class to create an adaptation of the parable of the unmerciful servant that teaches the same lessons about forgiveness using modern situations and details. (Consider having them work on this in groups.) Discuss how the parable answered Peter's question about how many times he should forgive.</li>
<li>The video "Forgive Every One Their Trespasses: The Parable of the Unmerciful Servant" (LDS.org) could help your class visualize the parable. In addition to Matthew 18:35, the following scriptures could help class members understand why the Lord wants us to forgive everyone who sins against us: Matthew 6:12–15; Ephesians 4:32; and Doctrine and Covenants 64:7–11.</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 10:25–37</heading>
<heading>To obtain eternal life, we must love God and our neighbors.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Here's an idea that might give class members a fresh view of the parable of the good Samaritan: Invite them to pretend that they are investigating a case of assault and robbery on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem. Ask a few class members to come to class prepared to represent the different people in the parable and talk about their involvement in the case. For example, why didn't the priest and Levite stop to help the injured man? Why did the Samaritan stop? What thoughts could the innkeeper add? How did the injured man feel about each of the others? Make sure the discussion inspires class members to be like the good Samaritan and the innkeeper and avoid being like the priest and Levite. When have class members felt like the "certain man," who needed help desperately? How did help come? How can we as ward members work together to help others, like the good Samaritan and the innkeeper did?</li>
<li>Besides teaching about what it means to love our neighbor, the parable of the good Samaritan could also symbolize Jesus Christ's power to save us. (Details about this interpretation can be found in "Additional Resources.") You might invite class members to read the parable, looking for this and other possible symbolic meanings. What do we learn about the Savior and His Atonement when we read the parable this way?</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 10:38–42</heading>
<heading>We choose "that good part" by making daily choices that lead to eternal life.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Life is filled with worthwhile things to do. The story of Mary and Martha can help class members consider how to choose "that good part" (verse 42; see also this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families). After reading Luke 10:38–42 together, perhaps you could ask class members how they might have reacted to the Savior's counsel if they had been in Martha's place. How might this experience have affected their future choices? How can we know what things in our own lives are "needful"? (Luke 10:42). How can Elder Dallin H. Oaks's message "Good, Better, Best" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 104–8) help class members?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Tell your class that as they read the Savior's declarations about His own divinity in John 7–10 for next week's class, they can come to know with greater surety that He is the Christ.</p>

<heading>Matthew 18; Luke 10</heading>
<heading>Talents and pence.</heading>
<p>It's difficult to know the exact values of the amounts of money mentioned in the parable of the unmerciful servant (see Matthew 18:23–35). However, there are clues in the New Testament that can help us understand the vast difference between the 100–pence debt and the 10,000–talent debt.
The fellowservant in the parable owed the smaller debt of 100 pence. In Matthew 20:2, a penny (the singular form of the word pence) is the wage paid for a day's work in a vineyard. Therefore, the fellowservant would have to work for 100 days to earn 100 pence to pay his debt. But this amount is extremely small when compared to the 10,000–talent debt of the unmerciful servant. In Matthew 25:14–15, a man's entire fortune — "his goods" — is valued at only eight talents. Therefore, it would take the combined, accumulated wealth of over 1,000 men like this man to pay the unmerciful servant's debt.</p>
<graphics-caption>Jesus spoke of money and debt to teach about forgiveness.</graphics-caption>
<heading>The immense debt Jesus Christ paid for each of us.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared what he learned about the parable of the unmerciful servant while attending an institute class:
"[The teacher] noted that the 100–pence forgiveness, which we were all expected to give one another and acknowledged as a pretty fair amount of money, was . . . preciously little to ask in light of the 10,000–talent forgiveness Christ had extended to us.
"That latter debt, our debt, was an astronomical number, [the teacher] reminded us, almost incapable of comprehension. But that, he said, was exactly the Savior's point in this teaching, an essential part of the parable. Jesus had intended that his hearers sense just a little of the eternal scope and profound gift of his mercy, his forgiveness, his Atonement.
". . . For the first time in my life I remember feeling something of the magnitude of Christ's sacrifice for me a gift bordering to this day on incomprehensibility. But a gift that made me, for the first time, seriously consider my need to forgive other people and to be unfailingly generous regarding their feelings and their needs and their circumstances" ("Students Need Teachers to Guide Them" [Church Educational System satellite broadcast, June 20, 1992]).</p>
<heading>Early Christian interpretation of the parable of the good Samaritan.</heading>
<p>Over the centuries, Christians have found symbols in the parable of the good Samaritan that teach about Jesus Christ's role as our Savior. For example, the man who fell among thieves could represent all of us. The thieves could represent sin and death. The Samaritan could represent the Savior. The inn could represent the Church, and the Samaritan's promise to return could represent the Savior's Second Coming. (See John W. Welch, "The Good Samaritan: Forgotten Symbols," Ensign, Feb. 2007, 40–47.)</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Follow the Savior's example.</b>As you read accounts of the Savior teaching in the New Testament, look for lessons in His example that can help you become a better teacher. For instance, in Luke 10:25–37, what did Jesus do to teach the lawyer about how to obtain eternal life?</p>

<heading>JOHN 7:14–17</heading>
<heading>As we live the teachings of Jesus Christ, we will come to know they are true.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members may better understand how living a commandment builds a testimony if they compare this pattern to the process of learning a skill through personal experience. For example, you could invite class members who know how to juggle or play a musical instrument to explain how they developed these skills. How did practicing on their own teach them more than merely watching someone else perform the skill? As a class, discuss how the effort involved in learning a skill compares to the spiritual pattern the Savior described in John 7:14–17. What experiences can class members share about following this pattern to gain spiritual knowledge?</li>
<li>How can you illustrate the truths taught in John 7:14–17? One idea is to ask members of your class to share experiences in which they gained a testimony of a gospel truth by living it. The account related by Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson in "Additional Resources" is also a good example. Give class members time to think of a gospel principle they would like to gain stronger testimonies of, and then encourage them to set specific goals to live that principle more fully.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 8:18–19, 26–29</heading>
<heading>As we come to know Jesus Christ, we come to know the Father.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland observed: "Some in the contemporary world suffer from a distressing misconception of [God the Father]. . . . Many moderns say they might feel comfortable in the arms of Jesus, but they are Elder Jeffrey R. Holland observed: "Some in the contemporary world suffer from a distressing misconception of [God the Father]. . . . Many moderns say they might feel comfortable in the arms of Jesus, but they are uneasy contemplating the stern encounter of God" ("The Grandeur of God," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2003, 71). What do the Savior's words in John 8:18–19, 26–29 teach about the connection between Him and His Father? After reading and discussing these verses, class members could list on the board some things Jesus did, said, or taught. What do we learn about God the Father from these things?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 8:1–11</heading>
<heading>The Savior's mercy is extended to all who repent.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To those who feel condemned because of their sins, the story of the Savior offering mercy and repentance to the woman taken in adultery could be a source of encouragement. Or, if class members feel tempted to condemn others because of their sins, the story could serve as a warning. You could invite them to read John 8:1–11, looking for answers to questions like the following: What does this story teach about the Savior's mercy? How might receiving His mercy when we sin help us when we feel tempted to judge others? (see Alma 29:9–10). You could also show the video "Go and Sin No More" (LDS.org).</li>
<li>To help class members find personal relevance in John 8:1–11, consider dividing the class into three groups — one to focus on the words and actions of the Pharisees, one to focus on the words and actions of the Savior, and one to focus on the words and actions of the woman. Invite each group to make a list of the spiritual truths they learn from reading each part of the account.</li>
<li>Sometimes we aren't aware of ways in which we judge others. Here's an activity to help class members overcome this tendency: Ask the class to help you create a list of ways we judge people (on their appearance, their behavior, their background, and so on). Give class members pieces of paper cut in the shape of a stone, and ask them to select a way of judging others that they feel they are guilty of and write it on a paper stone. What do we learn from the Savior's words to the Pharisees in John 8:1–11? Invite the class to write on the other side of their paper stones something that will remind them not to judge (perhaps a phrase from John 8).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Ask class members to think of a time when they lost something that was valuable to them. In the scriptures for next week's lesson, they will learn how Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ feel about those that are lost.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>John 7–10</heading>
<heading>Living a principle helps us gain a testimony of it.</heading>
<p>Sister Bonnie L. Oscarson said:
"The Savior taught, «If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself» [John 7:17]. Sometimes we try to do it backward. For example, we may take this approach: I will be happy to live the law of tithing, but first I need to know that it's true. Maybe we even pray to gain a testimony of the law of tithing and hope the Lord will bless us with that testimony before we have ever filled out a tithing slip. It just doesn't work that way. The Lord expects us to exercise faith. We have to consistently pay a full and honest tithe in order to gain a testimony of tithing. . . .
"I would like to share an example of how living a principle helps us become converted to that principle. . . .My parents and teachers at church had impressed upon me the value of treating my body with respect, keeping a clear mind, and most of all, learning to trust in the Lord's commandments. I made the decision to avoid situations where I knew alcohol would be present and to stay clear of tobacco and drugs. It often meant I was not included at parties, and I rarely dated. Drug use was becoming more and more common among young people, and the dangers were not as well known as they are today. Many of my peers later suffered permanent damage from mind-altering drugs or got caught up in serious addictions. I was grateful to have been taught to live the Word of Wisdom in my home, and I gained a deep testimony of that principle of the gospel as I exercised faith and lived it. The good feeling that came to me from living a true gospel principle was the Spirit of the Holy Ghost confirming that the principle was true" ("Be Ye Converted," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 77).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Live worthy of the Spirit's guidance.</b>When you live the gospel, you are worthy of the companionship of the Spirit, who is the best teacher.

<heading>No excuse is sufficient for rejecting the gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members study the parable of the great supper, you might invite them to an imaginary party that you will host. Let them share some reasons why they might or might not attend. Read Luke 14:15–24 together, and discuss the excuses the people in the parable made when they were invited to a feast that represented the blessings of the gospel. What excuses do people make today for failing to accept the Savior's invitations to receive Heavenly Father's blessings? Perhaps class members could share blessings they have received when they have made the sacrifices necessary to live certain gospel principles.</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 15</heading>
<heading>We can seek out those who are lost and rejoice with the Father when they return.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you inspire those you teach to seek out people who are "lost" because they do not have the blessings of the gospel and invite them to return? You might invite class members to think for a moment about "lost sheep" they know and then read Luke 15:1–7 with that person in mind. What do they feel inspired to do to reach out to that person with sensitivity and love? The story by President Thomas S. Monson in "Additional Resources" or Elder Mervyn B. Arnold's address "To the Rescue: We Can Do It" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 53–55) may help with this discussion.</li>
<li>Would it be helpful for class members to understand ways in which a person can become lost? Consider assigning groups of class members one of the three parables in Luke 15 to study. What do the parables suggest about how we should try to find those who are lost? What words in Luke 15 reveal how Heavenly Father feels about those who are lost? Singing "Dear to the Heart of the Shepherd," Hymns, no. 221, together might be a meaningful addition to the teachings of these parables.</li>
<li>Your class members may benefit from focusing on the words and actions of the older son in the parable of the prodigal son. Perhaps they could write an alternate ending to the parable in which the older son's attitude toward his brother is different. What does the father's counsel in the parable teach us about how we should feel about those who are lost and those who return to the gospel? (See also Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's statement in "Additional Resources.") Or you could ask class members to imagine that they are the father in this parable. What additional counsel would they give the older son to help him rejoice in the progress or success of others?</li>

<heading>JOHN 11:1–46</heading>

Invite them to share what they found. What other experiences have built their faith in Jesus Christ? You may want to point out that at the time of this miracle, Lazarus was not resurrected but brought back to mortal life.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Jesus Wept, by James Tissot</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>One way to examine John 11:1–46 is to ask class members to take turns reading the verses and invite them to stop when they find evidence of faith in Jesus Christ. Ask them to discuss what they have found. How can trials and infirmities strengthen our faith in Him?</li>
<li>Another way to read this account is to assign a few class members to consider the perspectives of the people involved — such as the Savior, the Apostles, Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.

<heading>"You found me."</heading>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson shared the following experience he had while serving as a bishop: "I noted one Sunday morning that Richard, one of our priests who seldom attended, was again missing from priesthood meeting. I left the quorum in the care of the adviser and visited Richard's home. His mother said he was working at a local garage servicing automobiles. I drove to the garage in search of Richard and looked everywhere but could not find him. Suddenly, I had the inspiration to gaze down into the old-fashioned grease pit situated at the side of the building. From the darkness I could see two shining eyes. I heard Richard say, «You found me, Bishop! I'll come up.» As Richard and I visited, I told him how much we missed him and needed him. I elicited a commitment from him to attend his meetings. . . . [Later], Richard said that the turning point in his life was when his bishop found him hiding in a grease pit and helped him to return to activity" ("Sugar Beets and the Worth of a Soul," Ensign, July 2009, 6–7).</p>
<heading>Learning from the other prodigal.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland made this observation about the prodigal son's older brother:
"This son is not so much angry that the other has come home as he is angry that his parents are so happy about it. Feeling unappreciated and perhaps more than a little self-pity, this dutiful son — and he is wonderfully dutiful — forgets for a moment that he has never had to know filth or despair, fear or self-loathing. He forgets for a moment that every calf on the ranch is already his and so are all the robes in the closet and every ring in the drawer. He forgets for a moment that his faithfulness has been and always will be rewarded.
"No, he who has virtually everything, and who has in his hardworking, wonderful way earned it, lacks the one thing that might make him the complete man of the Lord he nearly is. He has yet to come to the compassion and mercy, the charitable breadth of vision to see that this is not a rival returning. It is his brother. As his father pled with him to see, it is one who was dead and now is alive. It is one who was lost and now is found" ("The Other Prodigal," Ensign, May 2002, 63).</p>

<heading>MATTHEW 19:3–9</heading>
<heading>Marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Increasingly, the world's views on marriage diverge from eternal truth. To help your class learn about God's views on marriage, you might invite them to read Matthew 19:3–9 and list on the board the truths they find regarding marriage. They could also list additional truths they find in the following: Genesis 1:27–28; 1 Corinthians 11:11; Doctrine and Covenants 42:22; 49:15–17; 131:1–4; 132:19; and Moses 3:18, 21–24. How are these truths reinforced in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World"? (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 129).</li>
<li>How can you help class members feel better prepared to explain or defend the Lord's teachings on marriage? You could invite them to list on the board some questions they have heard about the Church's teachings regarding marriage. They could then suggest answers to these questions using what they know about the plan of salvation and statements from "The Family: A Proclamation to the World," Matthew 19:3–9, and the teachings in "Additional Resources." Consider inviting class members to role-play how they might explain our beliefs about marriage to someone who believes differently.</li>
<li>Consider introducing the topic of marriage with the following quote from Elder Robert D. Hales: "None of us marry perfection; we marry potential" ("Meeting the Challenges of Today's World," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 46). Invite class members to think of a married couple whom they admire. What qualities does this couple have? What qualities would class members want in a spouse, and what qualities do they want to develop in order to be a good spouse? Also consider what statements you could use from President Russell M. Nelson's message "Celestial Marriage" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 92–95) to help inspire class members to seek a celestial marriage.</li>

<li>What would help members of your class apply the principles in the parable of the laborers in the vineyard? You might invite a few class members to prepare a dramatization of the parable to present to the class. After the presentation, the people portraying the laborers could share how they felt about the payment they received and why. What does this parable suggest about the kingdom of heaven? What additional insights do class members gain about this parable from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's message "The Laborers in the Vineyard"? (Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 31–33).</li>

<heading>MATTHEW 19:16–22; MARK 10:17–27</heading>
<heading>The Savior will guide us closer to Him as we ask for His help.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help class members identify and apply principles in the story of the rich young man? One approach could be to ask them to read Mark 10:17–27 and consider whether they have ever felt like the rich young man. What has helped them to follow the Savior's counsel even when it's difficult? Can anyone in the class share an experience in which he or she asked, "What lack I yet?" (Matthew 19:20) and received a personalized prompting to improve? What difference did it make in his or her life?</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 18:9–14</heading>
<heading>We should trust God's mercy, not our own righteousness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Savior's parable comparing a Pharisee's prayer with a publican's can help you highlight the attitude that the Lord asks of those who seek to follow Him. To help class members apply this parable to our day, you could invite them to rewrite the Pharisee's prayer in a way that uses modern details but expresses the same attitudes. They could do the same with the publican's prayer and then share what they wrote. How do verses 15–17 and 18–24 relate to what the Savior taught in this parable?</li>
<li>How can these verses inspire those you teach to remain humble, as the publican was? Perhaps the following statement regarding these verses by Elder Dale G. Renlund could help: "The message for us is clear: a repenting sinner draws closer to God than does the self-righteous person who condemns that sinner" ("Our Good Shepherd," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 31).</li>

<heading>Matthew 19–20; Mark 10; Luke 18</heading>
<heading>Marriage is central to God's plan.</heading>
<p>The First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued this statement regarding same-sex marriage:
"We encourage all to bear in mind our Heavenly Father's purposes in creating the earth and providing for our mortal birth and experience here as His children [see Genesis 1:27–28; 2:24]. . . . Marriage between a man and a woman was instituted by God and is central to His plan for His children and for the well-being of society. . . .
". . . God expects us to uphold and keep His commandments regardless of divergent opinions or trends in society. His law of chastity is clear: sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife" ("LDS Church Instructs Leaders Regarding Same-Sex Marriage," Jan. 10, 2014, mormonnewsroom.org).</p>
<heading>Additional insights on marriage.</heading>
<p>"The Family: A Proclamation to the World" may be helpful in discussing why the Lord's prophets warn against anything that is contrary to marriage between a man and a woman. The following points may also be helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family is an eternal concept. We are all part of God's family, and His plan is that men and women be married and sealed so that they can live as families for eternity (see Genesis 2:18, 21–24; 1 Corinthians 11:11).</li>
<li>As part of God's plan, husbands and wives are commanded to multiply and replenish the earth (see Genesis 1:28) and nurture their children in righteousness.</li>
<li>The ultimate purpose of God's plan is exaltation, or eternal life, in God's presence, where faithful husbands and wives may have eternal increase and eternal joy (see D&amp;C 132:19–21). God's plan is the only way to achieve exaltation (see D&amp;C 131:1–4).</li>
<li>The Lord expects us to show love and compassion to those who advocate or participate in something other than God's plan for marriage, such as cohabitation or same-sex marriage (see mormonandgay.lds.org). True compassion includes doing our best to lovingly and patiently invite them to follow God's plan, which is the only plan of true happiness. To embrace or endorse alternatives to God's plan is more harmful than helpful.</li>

To help class members liken this account to their lives, invite them to imagine themselves as Zacchaeus. What do you think he learned about the Savior from his experience? What can we learn from Zacchaeus's efforts about seeking the Savior?</li>

<heading>Jesus Christ is our King.</heading>
<ul>
<li>A simple activity could introduce a discussion about the Savior's triumphal entry into Jerusalem: Several class members could draw on the board things associated with a king, such as a crown or a throne, while the others guess what they are drawing. Then other class members could draw a colt and tree branches. What do these things have to do with a king? You could then show the picture of the Savior's triumphal entry into Jerusalem from this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families and invite class members to read Mark 11:1–11. How did these people recognize Jesus as their King? How do we worship Jesus Christ as our King through our words and actions?</li>
<li>To help class members understand that Jesus Christ is our King, you might ask them to review the hymn "Come, O Thou King of Kings," Hymns, no. 59, or another hymn about Jesus as our King. What words from the hymn remind us of the truths in Matthew 21:1–11; Mark 11:1–11; Luke 19:29–44; and John 12:12–16?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 22:34–40</heading>
<heading>The two great commandments are to love God and love others as ourselves.</heading>
<ul>
<li>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught that making things other than the two great commandments the center of our lives is like shooting arrows at a blank wall and drawing targets around the arrows (see "Aiming at the Center," Ensign or Liahona, Jan. 2017, 4–5). Would exploring this analogy help class members understand Matthew 22:34–40? One way to do this would be to lay a large sheet of paper on the floor and let class members take turns dropping a pen or pencil onto it. Then they could draw targets where their pens or pencils hit the paper and label each target with a commandment. After reading Matthew 22:34–40 together, you could draw a new target that encircles all of the other targets and label it "Love God and Love Your Neighbor." How does focusing on the two great commandments help us obey God's other commandments? How can we make sure we focus our obedience on these two commandments?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 23:13–33</heading>
<heading>We will be protected as we avoid following blind guides.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Would your class members benefit from discussing the term "blind guides," which the Savior used to describe the spiritually blind Pharisees and scribes? (Matthew 23:16). You might think of a way to demonstrate what it would be like for someone to follow a person who couldn't see. Or the class could list on the board the characteristics of a blind guide, as described in Matthew 23:13–33. To add to the list, consider looking at additional scriptures that teach about spiritual blindness, such as 2 Corinthians 4:3–4; 2 Nephi 9:28–32; and Jacob 4:14. How can we recognize and avoid blind guides?</li>
<li>You may want to help class members understand that the scribes and Pharisees were more focused on the gold and gifts in the temple than the true meaning of the temple (see Matthew 23:16–22). To do this, consider sharing the parable of the pearl and the box by President Boyd K. Packer in "Additional Resources." What might distract us from enjoying the true blessings of the temple? of sacrament meeting?</li>

<li>Some people who believe in Jesus Christ may be unwilling to stand up for His gospel, especially in societies that disregard or mock religious beliefs. What lessons does John 12:42–43 have for us today? You could invite the class to search the following scriptures and identify people who desired to please men and people who desired to please God: Exodus 32:1–8; 1 Samuel 15:18–25; Matthew 14:1–10; 1 Nephi 6:1–6; Mosiah 17:1–12; and Moroni 8:16.

<li>Even though the Savior has asked us to always be ready for His Second Coming, it's easy to become involved in daily life and not think much about it. The parables in Joseph Smith–Matthew 1:26–27, 38–55 and Matthew 25:1–13 can help class members recognize the importance of being prepared for the Second Coming. Invite class members to find these parables and comparisons and share what they teach about being prepared for the Second Coming. Perhaps one or two class members can come prepared with a creative depiction of one of these parables.</li>
<li>The parable of the ten virgins can help class members reflect on their spiritual preparation to meet the Savior. Elder David A.

Why must each of us experience conversion for ourselves? What does Doctrine and Covenants 45:56–57 add to our understanding of this parable?</li>

<heading>The oil of conversion.</heading>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar suggested this possible interpretation of the parable of the ten virgins:
"Consider the oil to be the oil of conversion [see Matthew 25:4–9]. . . .
"Were the five wise virgins selfish and unwilling to share, or were they indicating correctly that the oil of conversion cannot be borrowed? Can the spiritual strength that results from consistent obedience to the commandments be given to another person? Can the knowledge obtained through diligent study and pondering of the scriptures be conveyed to one who is in need? Can the peace the gospel brings to a faithful Latter-day Saint be transferred to an individual experiencing adversity or great challenge? The clear answer to each of these questions is no.
"As the wise virgins emphasized properly, each of us must «buy for ourselves.» These inspired women were not describing a business transaction; rather, they were emphasizing our individual responsibility to keep our lamp of testimony burning and to obtain an ample supply of the oil of conversion. This precious oil is acquired one drop at a time — line upon line [and] precept upon precept' (2 Nephi 28:30), patiently and persistently" ("Converted unto the Lord," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2012, 109).</p>

Singing or listening to the hymn "Love One Another," Hymns, no. 308, or watching one of the videos in "Additional Resources" would be a good addition to this activity.</li>
<li>If we are not feeling particularly loving toward others, what can we do to seek after the gift of love? What does the counsel in Moroni 7:48; 8:26 add to our understanding of this gift? Who do we know that needs to feel our love?</li>
</ul>

<heading>The Holy Ghost enables us to fulfill our purpose as disciples of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members learn about the different roles of the Holy Ghost, consider dividing them into groups and giving each group one of the following passages: John 14:16–27; 15:26; and 16:7–15. Invite each group to write on the board what they learn about the Holy Ghost from these passages. Class members could add other insights they find as they explore the scriptures listed in "Additional Resources." When have we felt the influence of the Holy Ghost? What objects or visual aids could you bring to class that would help class members understand the roles of the Holy Ghost?</li>
<li>Consider inviting a few class members ahead of time to study one of the general conference addresses suggested in "Additional Resources" (or other conference addresses they know of) about the Holy Ghost. Allow them to share briefly what they learned with the class. What do these messages add to what we have learned about the Holy Ghost from John 14–16?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 15:1–12</heading>
<heading>As we abide in the Savior, we will be fruitful and have joy.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What did class members learn this week from the Savior's parable of the vine and branches? Consider bringing a small plant to class and using it to help class members visualize the Savior's parable. After reading John 15:1–12 as a class, you could discuss what it means to "abide in [Christ]" (John 15:4). You could invite a few class members to share how they have found John 15:5 to be true. (See also the statement from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in "Additional Resources.") The video "The Will of God" (LDS.org) might also be helpful in this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 17</heading>
<heading>Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are perfectly united, and They want us to be united too.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You probably can't teach all of the important truths found in John 17 in one class discussion, but here's a way to help the class explore several of them. List on the board concepts from John 17, such as these:
<ul>
<li>Our relationship with Jesus Christ</li>
<li>Jesus Christ's relationship with His Father</li>
<li>Our relationship with the rest of the world</li>
<li>Our relationship with each other as His disciples</li>
</ul>
Invite each class member to choose one of these concepts and to read John 17, searching for verses that are related to it. Ask several class members to share what they learn.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; and John 18 during the coming week, you could tell them that in these chapters they will read about one of the pivotal moments in God's great plan of salvation.</p>

<heading>Abiding in Christ.</heading>
<p>Noting that the word abide has connotations of permanence and commitment, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"The sense of this [word] then is «stay — but stay forever.» That is the call of the gospel message. . .Come, but come to remain. Come with conviction and endurance. . .
"Jesus said, «Without me ye can do nothing» [John 15:5]. I testify that that is God's truth. Christ is everything to us and we are to «abide» in Him permanently, unyieldingly, steadfastly, forever. For the fruit of the gospel to blossom and bless our lives, we must be firmly attached to Him, the Savior of us all, and to this His Church, which bears His holy name. He is the vine that is our true source of strength and the only source of eternal life. In Him we not only will endure but also will prevail and triumph in this holy cause that will never fail us" ("Abide in Me," Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 32).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Invite the Spirit.</b>"No mortal teacher, no matter how skilled or experienced, can replace the Spirit. But we can be instruments in God's hands to help His children learn by the Spirit. To do this, we invite the influence of the Spirit into our lives and encourage those we teach to do the same. . . . Sacred music, the scriptures, words of latter-day prophets, expressions of love and testimony, and moments of quiet contemplation can all invite the presence of the Spirit" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 10).</p>

<heading>Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; John 18</heading>
<heading>"Not as I Will, but as Thou Wilt"</heading>
<p>Read Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; and John 18, and ponder the thoughts and impressions that come to your mind. What messages do your class members need to learn?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Invite class members to share something they learned this week that helped them find more meaning in the sacrament. What did they do and how did it affect their experience partaking of the sacrament?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 26:26–29; LUKE 22:19–20</heading>
<heading>The sacrament is an opportunity to always remember the Savior.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Why did the Savior institute the sacrament? Why do we partake of the sacrament weekly? What possible answers can class members find in Matthew 26:26–29; Luke 22:7–20; Doctrine and Covenants 20:75–79; and True to the Faith, 147–49? For example, True to the Faith teaches that the sacrament commemorates Christ's sacrifice, which fulfilled the law of Moses. You may also want to read the sacrament prayers as a class and ask class members to identify the covenants we make as part of the ordinance. How could we help someone else understand what these commitments mean? How should our participation in the sacrament affect the choices we make throughout the week?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>When we partake of the sacrament, we renew our covenants.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Class members would likely benefit from hearing each other's ideas about how to remember the Savior during the sacrament and throughout the week (see D&amp;C 6:36–37). Perhaps you could invite them to share what helps them and their families remember the Savior and keep their covenants. What verses from this week's reading deepen our reverence for the sacrament? For other thoughts about how to always remember the Savior, see Gerrit W. Gong, "Always Remember Him," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 108–11.</li>
<li>This discussion could be a good opportunity to explore with class members the symbolism of the sacrament. How do these symbols help us focus on the Savior during the ordinance? What do these symbols teach us about Him and our relationship with him?</li>
<li>At the end of your discussion about the sacrament, you might give class members a few moments to ponder and write down what they feel inspired to do to prepare for the sacrament next week. To add to the spirit of this experience, consider playing a sacrament hymn while class members are pondering.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 26:36–46</heading>
<heading>We become more Christlike when we choose to submit our will to the Father's.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Savior's example of submitting to the Father's will can help your class members when they need to do the same. To start a discussion, you could invite each class member to share a time when they submitted themselves to something they knew God wanted them to do. What motivated them to do those things? Invite the class to read Matthew 26:36–42 and ponder why the Savior was willing to submit His will to His Father's. How can submitting our will to God ultimately bless us?</li>
<li>To explore the principle of submitting to God, you could ask half the class to read Mosiah 3:19 and the other half to read 3 Nephi 9:20. What do these verses teach about what it means to be submissive to God? How do we submit? Class members could ponder how they can submit their wills to God in the upcoming week. The statement from Elder Neal A. Maxwell in "Additional Resources" might also add to your discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 26:20–22, 31–35</heading>
<heading>We must examine our own lives to determine how the Lord's words apply to us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>We hear many gospel lessons in our lives, but sometimes it's tempting to assume those lessons apply mostly to other people. A discussion about Matthew 26 can help us overcome this tendency. To start this conversation, you could divide the class into pairs and ask one person in each pair to read Matthew 26:20–22 while the other reads verses 31–35. Invite them to contrast the disciples' responses in these two accounts. What lessons can we learn from how the disciples applied the Savior's words to themselves? To learn more, see President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's reference to Matthew 26:21–22 in his message "Lord, Is It I?" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 56–59).</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 26:36–46</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ performed an infinite Atonement for us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Matthew 26 describes what happened in Gethsemane, but do your class members understand its significance in their lives? To help them, maybe you could write on the board questions like<i>What happened in Gethsemane?</i>and<i>Why is it important to me?</i>Class members could work individually or in small groups to find answers in Matthew 26:36–46; Alma 7:11–13; and Doctrine and Covenants 19:16–19. They could also find answers in Elder C. Scott Grow's message "The Miracle of the Atonement" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 108–10).</li>
<li>In the Book of Mormon, Jacob calls the Atonement of Jesus Christ "an infinite atonement" (2 Nephi 9:7). To help class members understand what this means, you could share President Russell M. Nelson's teachings in "Additional Resources" and ask class members to list the ways that the influence of the Savior's sacrifice could be considered infinite. They could also read the following scriptures and add to their list: Hebrews 10:10; Alma 34:10–14; Doctrine and Covenants 76:24; and Moses 1:33. How can we show our appreciation for what the Savior has done for us?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to continue reading, you could ask them if they know what seven things Jesus said while He was on the cross. Tell them that they will find out what the Savior said by reading Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; and John 19.</p>

<heading>Submitting our will to the Father.</heading>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught: "As you submit your wills to God, you are giving Him the only thing you can actually give Him that is really yours to give. Don't wait too long to find the altar or to begin to place the gift of your wills upon it!" ("Remember How Merciful the Lord Hath Been," Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 46).</p>
<heading>The infinite Atonement.</heading>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson taught:
"[Jesus Christ's] Atonement is infinite — without an end. It was also infinite in that all humankind would be saved from never-ending death. It was infinite in terms of His immense suffering. It was infinite in time, putting an end to the preceding prototype of animal sacrifice. It was infinite in scope — it was to be done once for all. And the mercy of the Atonement extends not only to an infinite number of people, but also to an infinite number of worlds created by Him. It was infinite beyond any human scale of measurement or mortal comprehension.
"Jesus was the only one who could offer such an infinite atonement, since He was born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father. Because of that Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22; John 18 unique birthright, Jesus was an infinite Being" ("The Atonement," Ensign, Nov. 1996, 35).</p>
<p>President Heber J. Grant taught: "Not only did Jesus come as a universal gift, He came as an individual offering. . . . For each one of us He died on Calvary and His blood will conditionally save us. Not as nations, communities or groups, but as individuals" ("A Marvelous Growth," Juvenile Instructor, Dec. 1929, 697).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Look through God's eyes.</b>Strive to see your class members as God sees them, and the Spirit will show you their divine worth and potential. As you do this, you will be guided in your efforts to help them (see Teaching in the Savior's Way, 6).</p>

<heading>"It Is Finished"</heading>
<p>Begin your preparation to teach by prayerfully reading Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; and John 19. Remember that you will be able to bear powerful witness of the Savior and His Atonement as you live worthy of the Spirit.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>It might help to write on the board some words or phrases to remind class members of events that were described in the chapters this week. Ask class members to write on the board some words that describe how they felt when they read about these events. Why did they feel this way?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 27; MARK 15; LUKE 23; JOHN 19</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ's willingness to suffer shows His love for the Father and for all of us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help your class understand how the accounts of the Savior's death demonstrate His love, try an activity like this: Give each class member a paper heart, and invite them to write on their hearts a phrase from 1 Corinthians 13:4–7 that describes charity. Then ask them to search Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; or John 19 and write on the other side of their hearts a few verses that show how the Savior demonstrated the love described in the phrase they chose. Let them share what they find. What experiences have helped class members understand the Savior's love?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The soldiers "plaited a crown of thorns, and put it about his head" (Mark 15:17).</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>What can you do to encourage class members to share their testimonies of what they learned this week? Consider inviting class members to find a hymn that describes the events they read about or their feelings about the Savior's suffering and Crucifixion. Consider singing one or more of these as a class. How can studying about the Savior's final hours inspire us to trust and follow Him?</li>
<li>Art can help class members visualize some of the events they read about this week (see "Additional Resources" for suggested pictures). Perhaps you could divide the class into groups and give a picture to each group. The groups could read together the verses that describe what is depicted in their picture. They could discuss the meaning of the verses and share how the picture helps them better understand the verses. Each group could share their thoughts with the class. You might also consider showing the videos "Jesus Is Condemned before Pilate" and "Jesus Is Scourged and Crucified" (LDS.org).</li>
<li>You won't be able to discuss all of the details about the Savior's final hours as a class, but here's an activity that can help you discuss the details that are most meaningful to the people you teach. Invite each class member to select a chapter from this week's reading and spend a few minutes scanning it, looking for a word, a phrase, or a detail that teaches them something meaningful about the Savior and His mission. Give them opportunities to share what they found and explain why it is meaningful to them.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 27:14–60</heading>
<heading>Ancient prophets foresaw the Savior's suffering and Crucifixion.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It might strengthen the faith of those you It might strengthen the faith of those you teach to know that ancient prophets foretold many of the events in the Savior's final hours. One way to help class members review these prophecies and see how they were fulfilled would be to give each person one or more of the scriptures in "Additional Resources" and ask them to find the verses in Matthew 27 that show how the scriptures were fulfilled. You might make a chart that matches the prophecies with their fulfillments. You could suggest that class members write the verses containing the prophecies in the margins of their scriptures in Matthew 27. What do we learn from these prophecies? How do these prophecies strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MATTHEW 27:27–49; MARK 15:16–32; LUKE 23:11, 35–39; JOHN 19:1–5</heading>
<heading>Opposition cannot stop the work of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some of your class members may have faced opposition such as being judged or mocked when they have expressed their beliefs or tried to live their faith. Consider beginning your discussion by asking a few class members to share experiences when this has happened. How did they respond? Invite class members to read some of these verses from Matthew 27; Mark 15; Luke 23; and John 19 describing the persecution the Savior faced. What kinds of opposition does God's work face today? What can we learn from the Savior's responses that can help us face opposition in our day? Other scriptures that can help us when we face opposition include Matthew 5:10; Romans 12:14; 2 Timothy 3:10–12; Alma 1:19–28; and 3 Nephi 12:10–12. What do we learn from these verses?</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 23:34–43</heading>
<heading>The Savior offers us hope and forgiveness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Would it help your class members to read the account of the Savior asking the Father to forgive the soldiers and offering hope to the thief on the cross? Consider dividing the class into two groups and assigning one group to read Luke 23:34–38 (including verse 34, footnote c, which provides insight from the Joseph Smith Translation) and the other group to read Luke 23:39–43. Members of each group could discuss what they learn about the Savior from these verses and then share their thoughts with the entire class. How can we follow the Savior's example?</li>
<li>To help any in your class who may be having trouble forgiving others as Jesus did, consider sharing the statement by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read Matthew 28; Mark 16; Luke 24; and John 20–21 during the next week, ask them to think about what they would say to someone who said, "I need to see to believe." Tell them that next week's reading will help them address this concern.</p>

<heading>The Savior's example of forgiveness.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"Closely related to our own obligation to repent is the generosity of letting others do the same — we are to forgive even as we are forgiven. In this we participate in the very essence of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Surely the most majestic moment of that fateful Friday, when nature convulsed and the veil of the temple was rent, was that unspeakably merciful moment when Christ said, «Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.» As our advocate with the Father, He is still making that same plea today — in your behalf and in mine.
"Here, as in all things, Jesus set the standard for us to follow. Life is too short to be spent nursing animosities. . . . We don't want God to remember our sins, so there is something fundamentally wrong in our relentlessly trying to remember those of others" ("The Peaceable Things of the Kingdom," Ensign, Nov. 1996, 83).</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To help class members share what they learned in their personal and family study, ask them to write down a truth from this week's reading assignment that they feel should be shared with "all the world" (see Mark 16:15). At the end of class, ask them if they found any additional truths they would like to share.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 28; MARK 16; LUKE 24; JOHN 20</heading>
<heading>Because Jesus was resurrected, we too will be resurrected.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To give as many people as possible the opportunity to share what they have learned about the Resurrection, you could give class members a few minutes to review this week's reading assignment and "Resurrection" in the Bible Dictionary and write down truths they learned about the Resurrection. Let them share what they wrote, and encourage class members to raise their hands when they hear someone share a truth that is similar to what they wrote down. Why are these truths important to us? How does knowing that we will be resurrected affect our feelings about Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? Showing the music video "He Is Risen" (LDS.org) can help invite the Spirit into this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 24:13–35</heading>
<heading>We can invite the Savior to "abide with us."</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members see connections between their experiences and the experience of the disciples on the road to Emmaus, draw a road on the board, and invite class members to write details from the account in Luke 24:13–35 on one side of the road. Then, on the other side of the road, they could write parallels they see to their own experiences as followers of Jesus Christ. For example, they could write Their eyes were holden (Luke 24:16) on one side of the road and We sometimes don't recognize the Lord's influence in our lives on the other side.</li>
<li>There are two hymns based on Luke 24:13–35: "Abide with Me; 'Tis Eventide" and "Abide with Me!" Hymns, nos. 165, 166. How can you use these hymns to help class members find deeper meaning in the scriptural account?</li>

<li>The commandment that the resurrected Savior gave to His Apostles to preach His gospel can also apply to us today. How can you help your class members see their role in preaching the gospel? Perhaps you could invite them to imagine that they were giving some counsel to a family member or friend who is about to leave on a full-time mission. What would we share from the Savior's words to His Apostles? How can we apply these same words in our efforts to share the gospel with others?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JOHN 20:19–28</heading>
<heading>"Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed."</heading>
<ul>
<li>You may have class members who empathize with Thomas, who desired to see the risen Lord before he would believe. Your Sunday School class can be a place for class members to strengthen each other's faith in things that they cannot see. Perhaps you could start he would believe. Your Sunday School class can be a place for class members to strengthen each other's faith in things that they cannot see. Perhaps you could start by asking someone to summarize Thomas's experience in John 20:19–28. You could also show the video "Blessed Are They That Have Not Seen, and Yet Have Believed" (LDS.org). Class members could list on the board some things God asks us to believe without seeing. Then you could ask them to share experiences that have strengthened their testimonies of these things. What blessings have come to class members as they have exercised faith?</li>

<heading>The Savior invites us to feed His sheep.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What might help your class members accept the Savior's invitation to "feed [His] sheep"? You might start by inviting them to read John 21:15–17 silently, replacing Simon's name with their own name and "my lambs" and "my sheep" with the names of people they feel the Lord wants them to serve — for example, people they home or visit teach, neighbors, or people they know at work or school. After a few minutes, class members could share impressions they had. What does it mean to feed the Savior's lambs and sheep? The statements by President Russell M. Nelson and Elder Marvin J. Ashton in "Additional Resources" could help answer this question.</li>

<p>To inspire class members to read Acts 1–5 this week, ask them to pay attention to how an unlearned fisherman became the powerful leader of Christ's Church as it spread throughout the world. As they study these chapters, they will see how this transformation took place.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Matthew 28; Mark 16; Luke 24; John 20–21</heading>
<heading>What does it mean to feed the Savior's sheep?</heading>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson shared these insights from the ancient Greek text of John 21:
"In [John 21:15], the word<i>feed</i>comes from the Greek term<i>bosko,</i>which means «to nourish or to pasture.» The word<i>lamb</i>comes from the diminutive term<i>arnion,</i>meaning 'little lamb.'. . .
"In [John 21:16], the word<i>feed</i>comes from a different term,<i>poimaino,</i>which means «to shepherd, to tend, or to care.» The word<i>sheep</i>comes from the term<i>probaton,</i>meaning 'mature sheep.'. . ...
"In [John 21:17], the word<i>feed</i>again comes from the Greek<i>bosko,</i>referring to nourishment. The word<i>sheep</i>was again translated from the Greek term<i>probaton,</i>referring to adult sheep.
"These three verses, which seem so similar in the English language, really contain three distinct messages in Greek: 
<ul>

<heading>How can we "feed [His] sheep"?</heading>
<p>Elder Marvin J. Ashton explained how we can fulfill the Lord's commandment to feed His sheep:
"Jesus said, «Feed my sheep.» (John 21:16.) You can't feed them if you don't know where they are. You can't feed them if you give them reason to resist you. You can't feed them if you don't have the food. You can't feed them if you don't have charity. You can't feed them if you aren't willing to work and share. . . .
"Those who need help come in all age brackets. Some of His sheep are young, lonely, and lost. Some are weary, afflicted, and worn with age. Some are in our own family, in our own neighborhood, or in the far corners of the world where we can help with fast offerings. Some are starving for food. Some are starving for love and concern.
"If we give His sheep reasons to resist us, the feeding process becomes difficult, if not impossible. No one can teach or help with sarcasm or ridicule. Dictatorship or «I'm right and you are wrong» will negate all efforts to feed a wandering sheep. A wall of resistance will be built, and no one will benefit. . . .
"By our actions we show our love. Expressions of affection are empty if actions don't match. All His sheep need the touch of a shepherd who cares" ("Give with Wisdom That They May Receive with Dignity," Ensign, Nov. 1981, 91).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Reserve time for learners to share.</b>"When learners share what they are learning, they not only feel the Spirit and strengthen their own testimonies, but they also encourage other class members to discover truths for themselves. . . . Reserve time for student sharing in every lesson — in some cases, you may find that these discussions are the lesson" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 30).</p>

<heading>Acts 1–5</heading>
<heading>"Ye Shall Be Witnesses unto Me"</heading>
<p>As you read Acts 1–5 and seek the guidance of the Spirit, you will receive inspiration about what truths in the chapters will help your class members more fully rely on the Holy Ghost and be faithful witnesses of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>There are many meaningful passages and principles in Acts 1–5. One great way to discover which are the most valuable and relevant to members of your class is to let them tell you what stood out to them in their study. How will you invite this kind of sharing? It could be as simple as giving them a few minutes to find and share a verse from Acts 1–5 in which they felt the voice of the Lord speaking to them.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ACTS 1:1–8; 2:37–39; 4:1–16, 31–33</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ directs His Church through the Holy Ghost.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Reading about the experiences of the Apostles can help your class members see how they can receive power and guidance from the Holy Ghost in their Church callings. One way to review the experiences in Acts 1–5 would be to write on the board The Holy Ghost can help me in my calling by: and then invite class members to search Acts 1:1–8; 2:36–39; and 4:1–16, 31–33, looking for ways to finish the sentence. Why did the Apostles need the Holy Ghost?</li>
<li>As a class, you can also explore how Jesus Christ directs His Church in our day through the Holy Ghost. To do this, you could contact several class members beforehand and ask them to review the accounts in Acts 1:1–8; 2:37–39; 4:1–16, 31–33 and come prepared to share personal experiences that are similar to those of the Apostles. For example, they could share about a time when the Holy Ghost helped them testify of a gospel principle or answer someone's question. What had they done to seek the guidance of the Holy Ghost?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 1:15–26</heading>
<heading>The Apostles of Jesus Christ are called by God through revelation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It might help your class to note that new members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the ancient Church were called by revelation, just as they are today. Consider inviting class members to explain how a business might go about choosing a replacement for an executive position, such as looking at educational background, experience, and so on. Ask them to contrast this with how the Apostle Matthias was called in Acts 1:15–26 (see also 1 Samuel 16:1–13). How might the quotation by President Gordon B. Hinckley in "Additional Resources" add to the understanding of class members? (see also Russell M. Nelson, "Sustaining the Prophets," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 74–77). How does this knowledge affect our faith in the leaders the Lord has called? How have you gained your witness of modern apostles and prophets?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 2:22–47; 3:13–26; 4:5–12</heading>
<heading>We receive the blessings of the Atonement as we live the first principles and ordinances of the gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can those you teach find power and meaning in the simple truths Peter and John taught (faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end)? One way might be to explore the importance of these principles and ordinances, sometimes referred to as the doctrine of Christ (see 2 Nephi 31). You could bring five posters to class and write at the top of each poster one of the following aspects of the doctrine of Christ: Faith in Jesus Christ, Repentance, Baptism, Gift of the Holy Ghost, Endure to the End. Divide the class into five groups, and give each group one of the posters.</li>
<li>Invite the groups to review the definition of the topic on their poster in Guide to the Scriptures or Preach My Gospel. Then they could review Peter's teachings in Acts 2:22–47; 3:13–26; 4:5–12 and write on their poster examples of their assigned topic from the scriptures. How do these principles and ordinances of the gospel help us obtain the blessings of the Savior's Atonement? What roles do these principles and ordinances play in Heavenly Father's plan of salvation?</li>
<li>You could ask some full-time, recently returned, or ward missionaries to take a few minutes to explain how they have taught others about the doctrine of Christ using lesson 3 in Preach My Gospel. Why is the doctrine of Christ the main message of our missionaries? How does someone who has already been baptized and received the gift of the Holy Ghost continue to apply the doctrine of Christ?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 2:37–47</heading>
<heading>The Holy Ghost inspires us to act on what we learn.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As class members study the scriptures at home and together in class each week, they may often feel "pricked in their heart" (Acts 2:37). You may feel inspired to help them go a step further by asking, "What shall we do?" (Acts 2:37). Read Acts 2:37–47 together, inviting class members to search for things this group of 3,000 people did as a result of Peter's invitation. Maybe they could also share ways they have acted on inspiration from their study of the word of God. Then you might reserve time at the end of class for each person to ask themselves the question "What shall I do?" and record their impressions.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Despite being arrested and beaten, Peter boldly preached the gospel.</graphics-caption>
<heading>ACTS 3; 4:1–21; 5:12–42</heading>
<heading>As we are filled with the Holy Ghost, we can share the gospel with boldness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The account of Peter and John testifying of Jesus can inspire your class to not fear what others think as they share their witness of the gospel. What impresses class members about the boldness of Peter and John in Acts 3; 4:1–21; and 5:12–42? What is the relationship between receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost and our ability to testify boldly? The accounts of these chapters are dramatized in the videos "Peter Preaches and Is Arrested," "Peter and John Are Judged," and "Peter and John Continue Preaching the Gospel" (LDS.org). Class members might also have experiences to share when they, or someone they know, boldly defended or testified of the gospel.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Ask class members to think about how they would react if they knew that living the gospel could result in losing their lives. Tell them that in Acts 6–9 they will read about someone who was willing to die for his faith.</p>

<heading>The calling of a member of the Twelve.</heading>
<p>Gordon B. Hinckley shared the following insights about the process of calling a new Apostle: "The procedure is peculiar to the Lord's church. There is no seeking for office, no jockeying for position, no campaigning to promote one's virtues. Contrast the Lord's way with the way of the world. The Lord's way is quiet, it is a way of peace, it is without fanfare or monetary costs. It is without egotism or vanity or ambition. Under the Lord's plan, those who have responsibility to select officers are governed by one overriding question: «Whom would the Lord have?» There is quiet and thoughtful deliberation. And there is much of prayer to receive the confirmation of the Holy Spirit that the choice is correct" ("God Is at the Helm," Ensign, May 1994, 53).</p>

<heading>ACTS 7</heading>
<heading>Resisting the Holy Ghost can lead to rejecting the Savior and His prophets.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What truths did class members learn from reading the account of Stephen this week? Consider inviting class members to study the teachings of Stephen in Acts 7:37–53, looking for how the Jewish leaders were like the ancient Israelites who rejected the prophets. You might focus on Stephen's statement about these leaders in Acts 7:51. How do 2 Nephi 28:3–6; 33:1–2; Mosiah 2:36–37; Alma 10:5–6; and Alma 34:37–38 help class members understand Stephen's statement? Why might we "resist the Holy Ghost"? What can we do to better recognize and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 8:9–24</heading>
<heading>Our hearts need to be "right in the sight of God."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying the account of Simon can help class members evaluate the reasons why they live the gospel. To study this account as a class, you could write on the board the questions<i>Who was Simon?</i><i>What did he want?</i>and<i>How did he try to get it?</i>Assign each class member to read Acts 8:9–24, looking for answers to these questions. What do we learn from Simon's experience?</li>
<li>To help your class members understand what it means to have their hearts "right in the sight of God" (Acts 8:21), you could invite them to study Doctrine and Covenants 121:41–46, searching for words or phrases that describe what our hearts should be like as we strive to serve God and receive His gifts. Class members could compare these insights with the account of Simon, found in Acts 8:9–24. What truths did Simon not yet understand? How can we make our hearts "right in the sight of God"?</li>
<li>Did your class members compare Stephen and Philip with Simon during their personal study, as suggested in this week's outline in Come Follow Me—For Individuals and Families? If so, what did they learn? You might invite them to find evidence in these chapters that the hearts of other people were "right in the sight of God" — people such as Philip and the man from Ethiopia (Acts 8:26–40) and Saul (Acts 9:1–22).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 8:26–39</heading>
<heading>The Holy Ghost will help us guide others to Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members understand how they can guide others to Jesus Christ (see Acts 8:31), you might invite two class members to sit facing each other and read the dialogue of Philip and the man from Ethiopia in Acts 8:26–39. A third class member could read the parts that are not dialogue. What do we learn from Philip's example about teaching the gospel to others?</li>
<li>To help class members understand how they can apply the account in Acts 8:26–39, ask them to share experiences they have had with sharing the gospel or with joining the Church. How did the Holy Ghost help them? How did someone act as their guide? Invite class members to ponder whom they might guide to the gospel.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 9</heading>
<heading>When we submit to the Lord's will, we can become instruments in His hands.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members can learn powerful truths about their own conversion by studying Saul's experience, including the truth that everyone can repent and change if they are willing. You might ask class members to compare Saul's experience with the experiences of Alma (see Mosiah 17:1–4; 18; 26:15–21) and Laman and Lemuel (see 1 Nephi 3:28–31). What characteristics of Saul and Alma helped them repent and change? What characteristics kept Laman and Lemuel from changing? What influence did Saul and Alma have after they were converted? What messages do we find for our own lives from these accounts?</li>
<li>To help class members apply Saul's experience to themselves, you might invite a few class members to come prepared to share what they learn from each of the sections in President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's talk "Waiting on the Road to Damascus" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 70–77). How do we sometimes wait on our own road to Damascus? According to President Uchtdorf, what can help us better hear God's voice? You might also consider watching the video "The Road to Damascus" (LDS.org). To inspire class members to follow Saul's example and ask the Lord "What wilt thou have me to do?" consider discussing President Thomas S. Monson's experience found in "Additional Resources." Perhaps class members could share their experiences with seeking and following God's will.</li>
</ul>

<heading>Acts 6–9</heading>
<heading>"What Wilt Thou Have Me to Do?"</heading>
<p>While President Thomas S. Monson was attending a would visit a 10–year-old girl named Christal Methvin, who was dying of cancer. The girl's family lived 80 miles from the conference location. President Monson shared the following:
"I examined the schedule of meetings. . . . There simply was no available time. An alternative suggestion came public prayers at conference? . . .
". . . [During one of the meetings] I was sorting my voice speak to my spirit. The message was brief, the words familiar: «Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.» (Mark 10:14.) My notes became a blur. My thoughts turned to a tiny girl in need of a blessing. The decision was made. The meeting schedule was altered. . . .
". . . [At the Methvin home,] I gazed down at a child who was too ill to rise—almost too weak to speak. Her illness had now rendered her sightless. So strong was the spirit that I fell to my knees, took her frail hand in mine, and said simply, «Christal, I am here.» She parted her lips and whispered, «Brother Monson, I just knew you would come» " ("The Faith of a Child," Ensign, Nov. 1975, 20–22).</p>
<p>Years later, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf shared this story, inviting us to "strive to be among those whom the Lord can rely on to hear His whisperings and respond, as Saul did on his road to Damascus, «Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?»" ("Waiting on the Road to Damascus," Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 75).</p>

<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Guide your learners.</b>As a teacher, you can guide your learners through the scriptures, just as Philip guided the Ethiopian man by teaching him from Isaiah (see Acts 8:26–37). To do this, you must "seek learning even by study and also by faith" (D&amp;C 109:7). The knowledge you gain can be a powerful force in helping class members desire to discover truth for themselves and live it.</p>

<heading>ACTS 10; 11:1–18; 15:1–25</heading>
<heading>Heavenly Father teaches us line upon line through revelation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some class members might have misconceptions about the process of receiving revelation. It may help them to discuss how revelation came to Peter and how they can move forward, "doubting nothing" (Acts 10:20), when revelation seems incomplete or unclear. Consider drawing a line on the board and writing at one end of the line<i>The gospel is to be preached to the Gentiles</i>. As a class, review Acts 10 and 11:1–18, and then add points on the line that show how the Lord revealed to Peter step by step that the time had come to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. For instance, you might start with a point labeled "Cornelius saw a vision" (Acts 10:1–6) or even start with the Savior's command to His disciples to "teach all nations" in Matthew 28:19. What can we learn about revelation from Peter's experience? What do Nephi's teachings about revelation in 2 Nephi 28:30 and the teachings from Elder David A. Bednar and Elder Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources" add to the discussion?</li>
<li>How might you help class members think more deeply about how they receive revelation? You might study instances in the scriptures in which the Lord taught people line upon line. In addition to Peter's experience in Acts 10, class members could review the experiences of Nephi (1 Nephi 18:1–3), Alma (Alma 7:8; 16:20), and Mormon (3 Nephi 28:17, 36–40). What other examples can class members think of in which people received spiritual guidance "here a little and there a little"? (2 Nephi 28:30). Why might the Lord sometimes choose to reveal things in this way rather than giving us answers all at once? (see D&amp;C 50:40; 98:12). An analogy like this one might help: Suppose someone suggested that you take a calculus class before you had learned algebra or geometry. How would you respond? How does this relate to the Lord's pattern for revealing truth?</li>
<li>Sometimes members have questions or concerns about changes in the policies and programs of the Church. It might help them to discuss how the revelation to begin preaching the gospel to the Gentiles (see Acts 10) replaced the Lord's earlier instructions to His disciples (see Matthew 10:1, 5–6). How might class members respond to someone in Peter's day who disagreed with Peter's direction because it contradicted earlier practices? How can the revelation in Acts 10 help us heed the Lord's continuing revelation through His prophet?</li>
<li>It might be interesting to review the counseling together that took place among the Apostles, as described in Acts 15:1–22, and the letter they wrote to the Saints (see verses 23–29). You could show the video "The Jerusalem Conference" (LDS.org). What question did the disciples have? How did they seek an answer? The statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley in "Additional Resources" may shed additional light on how the Lord leads His Church through revelation to apostles and prophets.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 10:9–48</heading>
<heading>"God is no respecter of persons."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Would your class members benefit from a discussion about what it means to be "no respecter of persons"? You might start by inviting the class to read scriptures that teach that God is not a respecter of persons, such as Romans 2:1–11; 1 Nephi 17:34–40; 2 Nephi 26:32–33; Alma 5:33; Moroni 8:12; and Doctrine and Covenants 1:34–35. Ask class members to write possible definitions of "no respecter of persons," based on what they read, and then share what they wrote. You may need to help class members understand that being "no respecter of persons" does not mean that God blesses everyone equally regardless of our actions. He wants all of Acts His children to accept His gospel, but the fulness of the blessings of the gospel are reserved for those who make and keep covenants with Him. How do the events and principles in Acts 10:34–48 show that God is no respecter of persons? How can the righteous be "accepted" and "favored" by God even though He is not a respecter of persons? (see Acts 10:34–35; 1 Nephi 17:35).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 12:1–17</heading>
<heading>The prayers of the righteous can bring forth great miracles.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The account of Peter's deliverance from prison in Acts 12:1–17 can help class members build their faith in the power of prayer. Perhaps a class member could come prepared to share the details of this story and his or her testimony of prayer. Or you The account of Peter's deliverance from prison in Acts 12:1–17 can help class members build their faith in the power of prayer. Perhaps a class member could come prepared to share the details of this story and his or her testimony of prayer. Or you could invite one or more ward or branch members to share experiences in which they felt or witnessed the power of the united prayers of members. You might also sing hymns about prayer (such as "Did You Think to Pray?" Hymns, no. 140) and discuss what the hymns teach about the power of prayer.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Invite class members to ponder reasons we sometimes fail to share the gospel with others. Suggest that studying Acts 16–21 can help them overcome obstacles that can prevent them from sharing the gospel.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Receiving revelation line upon line.</heading>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar made the following observations about the Lord's pattern of revelation: "Many of us typically assume we will receive<i>an</i>answer or<i>a</i>prompting to our earnest prayers and pleadings. And we also frequently expect that such an answer or a prompting will come immediately and<i>all at once</i>. Thus, we tend to believe the Lord will give us a big answer quickly and all at one time. However, the pattern repeatedly described in the scriptures suggests we receive «line upon line, precept upon precept,» or in other words, many small answers over a period of time. Recognizing and understanding this pattern is an important key to obtaining inspiration and help from the Holy Ghost" ("Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept," New Era, Sept. 2010, 3–4).</p>
<graphics-caption>Personal revelation often comes over time through persistent effort.</graphics-caption>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks gave this counsel: "We should study things out in our minds, using the reasoning powers our Creator has placed within us. Then we should pray for guidance and act upon it if we receive it. If we do not receive guidance, we should act upon our best judgment" ("Our Strengths Can Become Our Downfall," Ensign, Oct. 1994, 13–14).</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley shared his perspective on serving in the Church's presiding councils: "At the outset in considering matters, there may be differences of opinion. These are to be expected. These men come from different backgrounds. They are men who think for themselves. . . .
". . . Out of this very process of men speaking their minds has come a sifting and winnowing of ideas and concepts. But I have never observed serious discord or personal enmity among my Brethren. I have, rather, observed a beautiful and remarkable thing — the coming together, under the directing influence of the Holy Spirit and under the power of revelation, of divergent views until there is total harmony and full agreement. Only then is implementation made. That, I testify, represents the spirit of revelation manifested again and again in directing this the Lord's work" ("God Is at the Helm," Ensign, May 1994, 54, 59).</p>

<heading>Acts 16–21</heading>
<heading>"The Lord Had Called Us for to Preach the Gospel"</heading>
<p>Before looking at this outline, prayerfully read Acts 16–21 with your class members in mind. The following ideas can supplement the inspiration you receive from the Spirit.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Consider inviting class members to share a passage from Acts 16–21 that reminds them of an experience they have had with sharing the gospel.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ACTS 16–21</heading>
<heading>As members of the Church, we testify of Jesus Christ and share His gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Because Acts 16–21 describes two of Paul's missionary journeys, class members may be able to learn from these chapters how to testify of Jesus Christ and share His gospel effectively. To inspire discussion on this topic, perhaps you could invite a few members to come to class prepared to share insights they gained from Acts 16–21 about sharing the gospel. To deepen the discussion, they might also share statements from a recent general conference address about missionary work. They could find a statement on their own, or you could suggest one of the messages in "Additional Resources."</li>
<li>One prominent message in these chapters is the important role of the Holy Ghost in sharing the gospel. For example, class members could discover how the Holy Ghost helped Paul and Silas in Acts 16:6–15. They could also read 2 Nephi 33:1 and Doctrine and Covenants 42:14 and share truths they find about the importance of having the Spirit when sharing the gospel (see also the statement by Elder Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources"). Perhaps class members could share experiences when the Holy Ghost guided their efforts to share the gospel. What are some experiences they have had with sharing the gospel with someone the Lord put into their path? (see also Preach My Gospel, 3–4).</li>
<li>How can you use Paul's experiences to help your class members have courage when they are prompted to share their testimonies? Consider reviewing together scriptural accounts that describe Paul testifying, such as his experiences in Macedonia (see Acts 16:19–34), in Athens (see Acts 17:16–34), and in Corinth (see Acts 18:1–11). What evidence do they find of Paul's courage and boldness? What doctrines did Paul understand and teach that gave him confidence in his message? Why are we sometimes afraid to share the gospel, and how can we overcome this fear? Perhaps the full-time missionaries could visit your class and share ways they have received the courage to testify. Encourage class members to think of one way they can follow Paul's example and be more courageous in sharing their testimony of Christ.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 17:16–34</heading>
<heading>We are the offspring of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>On Mars' Hill, Paul taught about Heavenly Father to a group of people who knew little about God's true nature. To explore these teachings, class members could read Acts 17:24–31 and write on the board the truths they find about Heavenly Father, our relationship with Him, and our relationships with each other. What experiences can class members share in which they have felt the truth of Paul's statement that God is "not far from every one of us"? (verse 27).</li>
<li>As you examine Acts 17:24–31 together, consider discussing the truth taught in verse 29: "We are the offspring of God," meaning that Heavenly Father is the literal Father of our spirits. To do this, you could write on the board<i>Because we are children of God</i>and<i>If we did not know we were children of God</i>. Invite class members to suggest ways to complete these sentences. Then consider asking: What does the fact that we are children of God teach us about God? about ourselves? about the way we should treat each other? How would our lives be different if we did not know about our true relationship with God? These questions might lead to a discussion about how we can help others understand that they are children of God. The statement by Elder Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources" may add to this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 19:1–7</heading>
<heading>Baptism must be followed by receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Acts 19 is a good place to emphasize how important it is to be confirmed after we are baptized. Consider sharing this statement from the Prophet Joseph Smith: "Baptism by water is but half a baptism, and is good for nothing without the other half — that is, the baptism of the Holy Ghost" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith, 95). How do Paul's teachings in Acts 19:1–7 confirm this statement by Joseph Smith? Class members may also benefit from searching "Holy Ghost, Baptism of" in the Topical Guide to learn more about the blessings of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.</li>

<p>"The Family: A Proclamation to the World" shares eternal truths about our relationship to God: "All human beings — male and female — are created in the image of God. Each is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 145).</p>
<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles spoke of the importance of seeing ourselves first and foremost as spiritual children of God:
"Be careful how you characterize yourself. Don't characterize or define yourself by some temporary quality. The only single quality that should characterize us is that we are a son or daughter of God. That fact transcends all other characteristics, including race, occupation, physical characteristics, honors, or even religious affiliation. . . .
"We have our agency, and we can choose any characteristic to define us. But we need to know that when we choose to define ourselves or to present ourselves by some characteristic that is temporary or trivial in eternal terms, we de-emphasize what is most important about us, and we overemphasize what is relatively unimportant. This can lead us down the wrong path and hinder our eternal progress" ("Be Wise" [Brigham Young University — Idaho devotional, Nov. 7, 2006], byui.edu).</p>

<heading>ACTS 22:1–21; 26:1–29</heading>
<heading>A testimony is a declaration of truth based on personal knowledge or belief.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Paul's testimony to Festus and King Agrippa can be an opportunity to discuss what it means to bear testimony. You might start by asking class members to review Acts 22:1–21 and 26:1–29. What do we learn from Paul's example about bearing testimony? What additional principles about bearing testimony do we learn from the statement by Elder M. Russell Ballard in "Additional Resources"? Singing or playing a hymn about testimony, such as "Testimony" (Hymns, no. 137), might help bring the Spirit into your discussion.</li>
<li>Class members may have gained personal insights as they studied Paul's testimony to Festus and King Agrippa. Invite them to share. What warnings can King Agrippa's response to Paul's testimony have for us today? (see Acts 26:28). Class members might also be able to think other testimonies from the scriptures that have inspired them. (Some examples include Job 19:25–27; 2 Nephi 33:10–15; Alma 5:45–48; and D&amp;C 76:22–24.) Or perhaps they could share experiences when they were influenced by someone's testimony.</li>
<li>The Prophet Joseph Smith compared his experiences with testifying of the First Vision to Paul's experience before King Agrippa (see Joseph Smith History 1:24–25). Perhaps class members could work in pairs to create a list of similarities between these two servants of God. How does this activity help us understand how to share our testimony even when doing so is hard?</li>
<li>Once Paul received a testimony of Jesus on the road to Damascus, he spent the rest of his life working to maintain and defend his testimony (see Acts 22:10, 14–16; 26:19). Paul's example could help your class understand that a testimony requires work and sacrifice. To start a discussion about this, perhaps a class member could describe his or her effort to become a skilled musician, artist, or athlete. How is developing such a skill similar to gaining and strengthening a testimony? What efforts must we make to gain and strengthen a testimony? (see also Alma 5:46).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 26:9–23</heading>
<heading>We have a responsibility to minister to others.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Lord called Paul to be "a minister" (Acts 26:16), but what does this word mean? To help class members explore how they can minister to others, you could write on the board a question like What does it mean to minister? Invite class members to look for answers in the following resources: Matthew 20:25–28; Acts 26:16–18; 3 Nephi 18:29–32; Guide to the Scriptures, "Minister," scriptures.lds.org. As they share what they find, encourage them to discuss ways we can all minister to others, including in our Church callings.</li>
<li>Brother David L. Beck spoke about priesthood holders' responsibilities to minister to others, and many of his insights can apply to all those serving in the Church (see "Your Sacred Duty to Minister," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 55–57). For example, what does the story of Chy Johnson teach us about ministering to others? The video "The Miracle of the Roof" (LDS.org) is also a good example of ministering. What other examples can class members share? Give class members time to think of someone to whom they can minister this week and how they will do so.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ACTS 27</heading>
<heading>If we heed the Lord's prophets, He will guide us and protect us from evil.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Your class members may have had experiences when they followed the direction of prophets even when it differed from the advice of worldly experts or the opinions of people around them. Invite a few class members to come to class prepared to share such experiences. Then invite class members to share how the people on the ship responded when Paul prophesied that the ship would suffer "hurt and much damage" (Acts 27:10). How are some people's responses to prophetic counsel similar in our day?</li>
<li>What do we learn from Acts 27 about following the Lord's prophets? The quotation by Elder Ronald A. Rasband in "Additional Resources" contains questions to ponder and a list of dangers that modern prophets have warned us against. How have we been blessed by following the counsel of living prophets?</li>

<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To help inspire class members to begin reading Paul's epistles, ask them to imagine that a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles wrote a personal letter to your ward.

<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Acts 22–28</heading>
<heading>Bearing testimony.</heading>
<p>Elder M. Russell Ballard spoke about Paul's testimony before King Agrippa and taught what it means for us to bear testimony:
"Our testimony meetings need to be more centered on the Savior, the doctrines of the gospel, the blessings of the Restoration, and the teachings of the scriptures. We need to replace stories, travelogues, and lectures with pure testimonies. Those who are entrusted to speak and teach in our meetings need to do so with doctrinal power that will be both heard and felt, lifting the spirits and edifying our people. . . .
". . . While it is always good to express love and gratitude, such expressions do not constitute the kind of testimony that will ignite a fire of belief in the lives of others. To bear testimony is «to bear witness by the power of the Holy Ghost; to make a solemn declaration of truth based on personal knowledge or belief» [Guide to the Scriptures, «Testify,» scriptures.lds.org]. Clear declaration of truth makes a difference in people's lives. That is what changes hearts. That is what the Holy Ghost can confirm in the hearts of God's children" ("Pure Testimony," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2004, 41).</p>
<heading>Standing with Church leaders.</heading>
<p>Elder Ronald A. Rasband taught:
"[Our leaders], by divine inspiration, have been called to teach and guide us and . . . are calling out to us to beware of the dangers we face each day — from casual Sabbath-day observance, to threats to the family, to assaults on religious freedom, and even to disputing latter-day revelation. Brothers and sisters, are we listening to their counsel? . . .
"As we press forward, choosing to follow the counsel and the warnings of our leaders, we choose to follow the Lord while the world is going in another direction. We choose to hold fast to the iron rod, to be Latter-day Saints, to be on the Lord's errand, and to be filled «with exceedingly great joy» [1 Nephi 8:12].
"The growing question of today is clear: are you standing with the leaders of the Church in a darkening world so that you might spread the Light of Christ?" ("Standing with the Leaders of the Church," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 47–48).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Prepare in advance.</b>"As you ponder how the gospel principles you are teaching will bless your class members, ideas and impressions will come throughout your daily life — as you travel to work, do household chores, or interact with family and friends.

<heading>"I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ."</heading>

<li>Have your class members ever faced ridicule for their beliefs? Invite them to read Romans 1:16–17 and think of instances from the book of Acts where Paul showed he was not ashamed of the gospel. What are some things that make us unashamed to be members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? Invite class members to share experiences in which they or others showed that they were not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li>

<heading>ROMANS 1:16–17; 2:28–29; 6:1–11</heading>
<heading>True discipleship is found in our inward commitment, not just in our actions.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How do we evaluate our own discipleship? Paul's counsel to the Romans can help us remember to focus not on completing a checklist of tasks but on "the heart [and] the spirit" (Romans 2:29). To help your class understand Paul's counsel, you could write the text from Romans 2:28–29 on the board. Replace the word Jew with Latter-day Saint and the word circumcision with the covenant. What does this change add to our understanding of Paul's teachings? You could also discuss examples of things we do as Church members that are more meaningful and powerful when done 'of the heart, in the spirit' (Romans 2:29). For example, see Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's message about home teaching, "Emissaries to the Church" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 61–67), or Elder Neil L. Andersen's message about missionary work, "A Witness of God" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 35–38).</li>

<heading>ROMANS 3–6</heading>
<heading>"Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound."</heading>
<ul>
<li>There may be people in your class who need help understanding Paul's teachings in these chapters about faith, works, and grace (see also this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families and the Joseph Smith Translation for these chapters in the footnotes and the Bible appendix). How can you help them learn from each other? Consider presenting the following two scenarios to help class members understand that we should not see our good works as a way to prove our worthiness, nor should we see Christ's grace as a reason to excuse our mistakes and sins. Invite class members to search for truths in Romans 3:20–31; 5:1–2; 6:1–2, 21–23 that could help Gloria and Justin. What other doctrinal truths in "Additional Resources" would help them understand the importance of both performing righteous works and trusting in the grace of Christ? You could ask class members to share what they found or role-play a conversation.
<b>Scenario 1</b>
You have a friend named Gloria who feels overwhelmed in her efforts to be a faithful disciple. She works hard to do everything she feels she should do, but she often worries that her efforts fall short. "Am I good enough?" she wonders. "Will the Lord accept me?"
<b>Scenario 2</b>
You have a friend named Justin who doesn't worry too much about making righteous choices. He believes in Jesus Christ, he attends his church meetings, and he is a loving father and a good neighbor.
However, he has chosen not to live the standards that would qualify him for a temple recommend. When family and friends try to encourage him to prepare for the temple, he responds, "I'm a good person. I have faith in Christ. He already paid the price for my sins, and I don't think He's going to keep me out of the celestial kingdom over such minor issues."</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read Romans 7–16, you could tell them that Paul described a war inside him and all of us. In Romans 7–16 we find out what that war is and how to win it.</p>

<heading>Romans 1–6</heading>
<heading>Faith, grace, and works.</heading>
<p>While we should strive to follow the commandments, obedience to God's laws alone will not save us (see Romans 3:27–31). Even with our best efforts, we "all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). For that reason, we all need Jesus Christ, whose grace allows us to be forgiven of our sins and enables us to continue doing good works. As Paul taught, "Where sin abounded, grace did much more abound" (Romans 5:20).</p>
<p>President David O. McKay shared an analogy about a boy who began to drown while swimming with his friends:
"Fortunately, one with presence of mind and quick action, jerked a long stick from a willow fence and held one end of it toward the drowning lad [who] grasped it, held on tightly and was saved.
"All the boys declared that the venturesome lad owed his life to the boy who furnished the means of rescue.
"This is undoubtedly the fact; and yet in spite of the means furnished him, if the lad had not taken advantage of it, if he had not put forth all the personal effort at his command, he would have drowned, notwithstanding the heroic act of his comrade" (David O. McKay, "The Gospel of Work," Instructor, Jan. 1955, 1).</p>
<p>Addressing the question of whether we are saved by faith or works, Christian author C. S. Lewis wrote: "It [seems] to me like asking which blade in a pair of scissors is most necessary" (Mere Christianity, 148).</p>

<p>"Salvation cannot be bought with the currency of obedience; it is purchased by the blood of the Son of God [see Acts 20:28]. . . .
"Grace is a gift of God, and our desire to be obedient to each of God's commandments is the reaching out of our mortal hand to receive this sacred gift from our Heavenly Father" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Gift of Grace," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 109–10).</p>

<p>"If grace is a gift of God, why then is obedience to God's commandments so important? Why bother with God's commandments — or repentance, for that matter?. . .
"Our obedience to God's commandments comes as a natural outgrowth of our endless love and gratitude for the goodness of God. This form of genuine love and gratitude will miraculously merge our works with God's grace" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Gift of Grace," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 109).</p>
<heading>Our ongoing need for grace.</heading>
<p>"In addition to needing grace for your ultimate salvation, you need this enabling power every day of your life. As you draw near to your Heavenly Father in diligence, humility, and meekness, He will uplift and strengthen you through His grace [see Proverbs 3:34; 1 Peter 5:5; D&amp;C 88:78; 106:7–8]. Reliance upon His grace enables you to progress and grow in righteousness" (True to the Faith, 78).</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Class members should feel free to share anything that inspired them in their personal or family study, but sometimes it helps to ask for thoughts about something specific.

<heading>Through Jesus Christ, we can inherit all that Heavenly Father has.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As Latter-day Saints, we believe that phrases such as "heirs of God" and "joint-heirs with Christ" mean that with Jesus Christ's help, we can become like Heavenly Father and receive all He has (Romans 8:17; see also D&amp;C 132:19–20). To help class members see how this doctrine is taught throughout Read Romans 7–16, and record impressions you receive about how to help members of your class learn from the scriptures. At first your impressions may seem like simple ideas, but as you ponder them, they can become meaningful learning activities. the scriptures, you could invite half of the class to study some of the Bible verses listed in "Additional Resources" and the other half to study verses from latter-day scripture, also in "Additional Resources." Then class members could teach each other what they learned. Give them time to discuss why this doctrine is so important. For example, what difference does it make in our lives to know that we can become "heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ"? (Romans 8:17).</li>
<li>Remembering that eternal blessings await the faithful can help us when we face temptation or trials (see Romans 8:18). A simple way to illustrate this principle could be to draw a balance or scale on the board; ask class members to list on one side some trials people may face. Then they could search some of the scriptures in "Additional Resources" and list on the other side of the scale descriptions of eternal blessings that come to those who face their trials faithfully. How do the trials compare with the promised blessings? What would we say to someone who asked us if it is worth it to be faithful to the Lord's commandments?</li>
<li>The analogy given by Elder Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources" could help class members discuss how we can prepare to become "heirs of God" (Romans 8:17). What are some of the "laws and principles" Elder Oaks refers to?</li>

Consider displaying the full-page image in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families or another picture of Jesus Christ while you read Romans 8:18, 28, 31–39 as a class. What thoughts or feelings do class members have after reading these verses? You might invite a few class members to share how they have gained testimonies of the truths they find in these verses. You might also sing a hymn as a class (or ask someone to perform a musical number) about the love of God and Jesus Christ, such as "God Loved Us, So He Sent His Son" or "I Stand All Amazed" (Hymns, nos. 187, 193).

<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks related the following parable:
"A wealthy father knew that if he were to bestow his wealth upon a child who had not yet developed the needed wisdom and stature, the inheritance would probably be wasted. The father said to his child:
"«All that I have I desire to give you—not only my wealth, but also my position and standing among men. That which I have I can easily give you, but that which I am you must obtain for yourself. You will qualify for your inheritance by learning what I have learned and by living as I have lived. I will give you the laws and principles by which I have acquired my wisdom and stature. Follow my example, mastering as I have mastered, and you will become as I am, and all that I have will be yours»" ("The Challenge to Become," Ensign, Nov. 2000, 32).</p>
<heading>Heirs of God.</heading>
<p>"Latter-day Saints see all people as children of God in a full and complete sense; they consider every person divine in origin, nature, and potential. . . . Just as a child can develop the attributes of his or her parents over time, the divine nature that humans inherit can be developed to become like their Heavenly Father's. . . . Men and women have the potential to be exalted to a state of godliness" ("Becoming Like God," Gospel Topics, topics.lds.org).</p>
<heading>Judging others.</heading>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:
"This topic of judging others could actually be taught in a two-word sermon. When it comes to hating, gossiping, ignoring, ridiculing, holding grudges, or wanting to cause harm, please apply the following:
"Stop it!
"It's that simple. We simply have to stop judging others and replace judgmental thoughts and feelings with a heart full of love for God and His children. God is our Father. We are His children. We are all brothers and sisters. . . . A bumper sticker I recently saw. . . was attached to the back of a car whose driver appeared to be a little rough around the edges, but the words on the sticker taught an insightful lesson. It read, «Don't judge me because I sin differently than you»" ("The Merciful Obtain Mercy," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 75).</p>

<heading>The members of Christ's church must be unified.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Discussing the first few chapters of 1 Corinthians may be an opportunity to build greater unity among ward members. You could start by asking class members to talk about a club, group, or team they belonged to that had a great sense of unity. Why did this group feel so united? You could then explore some of Paul's teachings on unity in 1 Corinthians 1:10–13; 3:1–11. What do these verses, along with our experiences, teach about what helps create unity and what threatens it? What blessings come to those who are united? The stories shared by President Henry B. Eyring in "Additional Resources" could also help this discussion.</li>
<li>In 1 Corinthians 3:9–17, Paul used the image of a building to encourage unity. How could this analogy help your class better understand unity? For example, after reading these verses together, you could give each class member a block and work together to build something. In what sense are we "God's building"? (1 Corinthians 3:9). How is God building us individually? What are we building together as fellow Saints? What can we do as a unified ward that we wouldn't be able to do as individuals?</li>

Here's an idea to help your class rely on God: Divide class members into groups and ask them to scan 1 Corinthians 1:17–31; 2; or 3:18–20 searching for words like wise and foolish. Then they could share in their groups what these verses teach about being wise in the Lord's work. What are things about the gospel that might seem foolish to some people? How do these things demonstrate the wisdom of God? Perhaps class members could share experiences in which they trusted in God's wisdom, rather than their own, to accomplish His work.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 6:9–20</heading>
<heading>Our physical bodies are sacred.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To begin a discussion about these verses, you might write on the board questions like the following: How does the Lord view our bodies? How is this different from the way Satan wants us to think of our bodies? What does it mean that our bodies are temples of the Holy Ghost? Invite class members to find answers to these questions in 1 Corinthians 6:9–20 (see also D&amp;C 88:15; Moses 6:8–9).</li>
<li>Your discussion about the sanctity of our bodies could include a conversation about the law of chastity. This could be particularly helpful because as Latter-day Saints, we often have opportunities to explain our beliefs about chastity to those who may not share those beliefs. Perhaps you could ask your class members what they learn from Paul — as well as from other Church resources — that could help them explain to others why chastity is important. Some of these resources may include those listed in "Additional Resources."</li>

<heading>Examples of unity.</heading>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring taught:
"I was invited to kneel at bedtime with a family when I was a guest in their home. The smallest child was asked to be voice. He prayed like a patriarch for every person in the family, by name. I opened my eyes for an instant to see the faces of the other children and the parents. I could tell that they were joining their faith and their hearts in that little boy's prayer.
"Some Relief Society sisters recently prayed together as they prepared to visit for the first time a young widow whose husband died suddenly. They wanted to know what to do and how to work together to help prepare the home for family and friends who would come at the time of the funeral. . . . An answer to their prayer came. When they arrived at the house, each sister moved to complete a task. The house was ready so quickly that some sisters regretted not being able to do more. Words of comfort were spoken which fit perfectly together. They had given the Lord's service as one, hearts knit together" ("Our Hearts Knit as One," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 68–69).</p>
<heading>The blessings of sexual purity.</heading>
<p>At a Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults, Sister Wendy W. Nelson said:
"Personal purity is the key to true love. The more pure your thoughts and feelings, your words and actions, the greater your capacity to give and receive true love. . . .
"As an important part of the expression of their love, the Lord wants a husband and wife to partake of the wonders and joys of marital intimacy. . . .
". . .Anything that invites the Spirit into your life, and into the life of your spouse and your marriage, will increase your ability to experience marital intimacy. . . .On the other hand, anything that offends the Spirit will decrease your ability to be one with your spouse. . . . "Marital intimacy endorsed by the Spirit is blessed by the Lord and is sanctifying" ("Love and Marriage," Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults, Jan. 8, 2017, broadcasts.lds.org).</p>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"May I stress that human intimacy is reserved for a married couple because it is the ultimate symbol of total union, a totality and a union ordained and defined by God. . . .
"But such a total union, such an unyielding commitment between a man and a woman, can only come with the proximity and permanence afforded in a marriage covenant, with solemn promises and the pledge of all they possess — their very hearts and minds, all their days and all their dreams" ("Personal Purity," Ensign, Nov. 1998, 76).</p>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar explained: "[Sexual] relations are not merely a curiosity to be explored, an appetite to be satisfied, or a type of recreation or entertainment to be pursued selfishly. They are not a conquest to be achieved or simply an act to be performed. Rather, they are in mortality one of the ultimate expressions of our divine nature and potential and a way of strengthening emotional and spiritual bonds between husband and wife. We are agents blessed with moral agency and are defined by our divine heritage as children of God — and not by sexual behaviors, contemporary attitudes, or secular philosophies" ("We Believe in Being Chaste," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 42).</p>

<p>Paul used analogies and imagery in 1 Corinthians 8–13, such as a runner in a race, a human body, and "a tinkling cymbal" (1 Corinthians 13:1). What insights do class members have about this imagery? How did it help them understand a gospel truth?</p>

<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 10:1–13</heading>
<heading>We all face temptation, but God provides a way to escape it.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help class members discover powerful truths in 1 Corinthians 10:13? One idea is to divide the verse into brief phrases, give each one to a different class member, and ask the class members to restate the phrases in their own words. For example, what is another way to say "God is faithful" or "tempted above that ye are able"? You could then put some of the class members' statements back together and look for further applications to our lives. Class members may be able to share experiences when they found the promises in this verse to be true. What additional insights can we gain into these verses from Alma 13:27–28?</li>
<li>Rather than dwelling on anyone's specific temptations, you might want to focus the discussion of 1 Corinthians 10:13 on temptations that are, in Paul's words, "common to man." Class members could start by identifying temptations Paul warned against in verses 1–12. They might also suggest modern examples of common temptations, such as temptations to be dishonest, gossip, or judge others. How might a person, with God's help, "escape" these temptations? You may want to role-play some situations.</li>
<li>It may be valuable to consider 1 Corinthians 10:13 in the context of Paul's overarching desire for unity among the Saints. What can we do to help each other "escape" and "bear" the temptations we might face? How does unity help us resist temptation?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 10:16–17; 11:23–30</heading>
<heading>The sacrament unifies us as members of Christ's Church.</heading>
<ul>
<li>These verses could inspire a discussion about how the sacrament can unify your ward in your efforts to become more like the Savior. You might begin by reading 1 Corinthians 10:16–17 and exploring what the word communion could mean in this context (someone could look for possible definitions in a dictionary). How has partaking of the sacrament together helped us feel more united? What can we do to foster unity during sacrament meeting? How does Paul's counsel to "let a man examine himself" relate to this goal? (1 Corinthians 11:28).</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 12</heading>
<heading>We should seek for gifts of the Spirit to benefit all of Heavenly Father's children.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help your class members review the spiritual gifts Paul described and recognize the great variety of spiritual gifts? You could give them one minute to write a list of as many gifts of the Spirit they can think of. When they are done, invite gift they listed has been mentioned. Then class members could find other gifts to add to their lists by searching 1 Corinthians 12 and Elder Marvin J. Ashton's list in "Additional Resources." Which of these gifts have class members seen in people they know? How might developing these gifts help us become like Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>To help class members see examples of how developing their spiritual gifts helps edify the Church, consider inviting them to think of spiritual gifts people in the scriptures had. For ideas, you could assign them to search one of the scripture references in "Additional Resources" and share the spiritual gifts they think that person had. How did these people's spiritual gifts bless themselves and others? How can we use our spiritual gifts to bless others and edify the body of Christ, or the Church? (see 1 Corinthians 12:12–31; see also 1 Corinthians 14:12).</li>
<li>To help class members understand how to develop spiritual gifts, invite them to read 1 Corinthians 12:27–31; Moroni 7:48; 10:23, 30; Doctrine and Covenants 46:8; and the quotation by President George Q. Cannon in "Additional Resources." What do these resources teach us about how to obtain spiritual gifts? How does developing spiritual gifts make us more like Christ? Invite class members to select a gift they would like to obtain and to seek the Lord's help in acquiring that gift.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 13</heading>
<heading>Charity is the greatest spiritual gift.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some people think of charity as donations to the poor or kindness toward others. While these things can certainly demonstrate charity, Paul's description is even more expansive. To help class members analyze it, you could ask them to silently ponder 1 Corinthians 13 and think of someone they know who is a good example of one or more aspects of charity Paul mentions. Some class members could describe the person they thought of and an experience in which this person exemplified charity. You might even list parts of Paul's description on the board and invite class members to share ideas about what it means to "suffereth long" or "not [be] easily provoked" (1 Corinthians 13:4–5). How did the Savior exemplify these attributes of charity? How do we develop charity? (see Moroni 7:46–48).</li>

<p>President George Q. Cannon (1827–1901) of the First Presidency said that it is our duty "to pray to God to give [us] the gifts that will correct [our] imperfections. . . . They are intended for this purpose. No man ought to say, «Oh, I cannot help this; it is my nature.» He is not justified in it, for the reason that God has promised to give strength to correct these things, and to give gifts that will eradicate them. If a man lack wisdom, it is his duty to ask God for wisdom. The same with everything else" (Millennial Star, Apr. 23, 1894, 260).</p>

<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 14</heading>
<heading>When Saints gather together, they should seek to edify one another.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Consider using Paul's teachings in 1 Corinthians 14 to remind class members that we can all edify — or support and uplift — each other at church. A simple way to review this chapter might be to write a question on the board, such as What should be our goal when we gather together? Invite class members to search for possible answers in 1 Corinthians 14. Other ideas could be found in Moroni 6:4–5 and Doctrine and Covenants 50:17–23. As class members share what they find, consider asking them how they feel your class is doing at accomplishing these goals. They could also share experiences when they felt edified by something a class member shared.</li>
<li>To help class members understand Paul's counsel that members should seek to prophesy, consider asking them to suggest definitions for the word prophesy. You or the class members could write each definition on the board and review together the definition of prophesy in Guide to the Scriptures and Paul's counsel in 1 Corinthians 14:3, 31, 39–40. What can we add to our definitions from these resources? (see also Revelation 19:10). What are we inspired to do at church and at home as a result of Paul's teachings?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 CORINTHIANS 15</heading>
<heading>Because Jesus Christ was resurrected, we will all be resurrected.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you use Paul's testimony in 1 Corinthians 15 to strengthen your class members' testimonies of the Resurrection? One way could be to divide the class into two groups and ask one group to look in 1 Corinthians 15 for the consequences we would face if Jesus Christ had not been resurrected. The other group could look for the blessings we receive because of His Resurrection. Each group could then write on the board what they learned. What could they add to their lists after reading the statement by Elder D. Todd Christofferson in "Additional Resources"? To help class members feel the Spirit during this discussion, consider displaying a picture of the resurrected Savior (see this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families).</li>
<li>Because Paul was responding to people who did not believe in resurrection, your class might benefit from role-playing a similar situation. For example, how might they strengthen a loved one's faith in the Resurrection? What do class members find in 1 Corinthians 15 that would help them explain the need for and the evidence of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ? What other scriptures could they use? (see, for example, Luke 24:1–12, 36–46; Alma 11:42–45).</li>
<li>Paul refers to three degrees of resurrected glory several times in his epistles (see 1 Corinthians 15:40–42 and 2 Corinthians 12:1–2). To help your class discover how modern revelation expounds on Paul's teachings, you could divide the class into three groups and give each group a piece of paper shaped like a sun (D&amp;C 76:50–70), a moon (D&amp;C 76:71–80), or a star (D&amp;C 76:81–89). Invite them to read the associated scriptures from Doctrine and Covenants 76 and share what we need to do to receive the different glories Paul described. See also Doctrine and Covenants 131:1–4; 137:7–10.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>"There is one glory of the sun" (1 Corinthians 15:41).</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>1 Corinthians 15 is one of the few places in the scriptures where baptisms for the dead are mentioned (see verse 29; see also D&amp;C 128:18). Perhaps class members could share experiences they've had performing baptisms or other ordinances for their ancestors. Consider sharing Wilford Woodruff's experience in "Additional Resources" as part of the discussion. Why might Paul refer to baptisms for the dead as evidence of the Resurrection? If it would help to discuss why baptisms for the dead are necessary, see "Baptisms for the Dead," Gospel Topics, topics.lds.org. The video "Glad Tidings: The History of Baptisms for the Dead" (LDS.org) explains how this principle was restored in our day.</li>

<heading>Significance of the Resurrection.</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught:
"Consider for a moment the significance of the Resurrection in resolving once and for all the true identity of Jesus of Nazareth and the great philosophical contests and questions of life. If Jesus was in fact literally resurrected, it necessarily follows that He is a divine being. No mere mortal has the power in himself to come to life again after dying. Because He was resurrected, Jesus cannot have been only a carpenter, a teacher, a rabbi, or a prophet. Because He was resurrected, Jesus had to have been a God, even the Only Begotten Son of the Father.
"Therefore, what He taught is true; God cannot lie.
"Therefore, He was the Creator of the earth, as He said.
"Therefore, heaven and hell are real, as He taught.
"Therefore, there is a world of spirits, which He visited after His death.
"Therefore, He will come again, as the angels said, and «reign personally upon the earth.»
"Therefore, there is a resurrection and a final judgment for all" ("The Resurrection of Jesus Christ," Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 113).</p>
<heading>Ordinances for the dead: "A shaft of light from the throne of God."</heading>
<p>Elder Wilford Woodruff said that when he learned that living members of the Church could receive saving ordinances in behalf of their ancestors who had passed away, "it was like a shaft of light from the throne of God to our hearts. It opened a field wide as eternity to our minds." He also commented: "It appeared to me that the God who revealed that principle unto man was wise, just and true, possessed both the best of attributes and good sense and knowledge. I felt he was consistent with both love, mercy, justice and judgment, and I felt to love the Lord more than ever before in my life. . . . I felt to say hallelujah when the revelation came forth revealing to us baptism for the dead. . . ."
"The first thing that entered into my mind," he said, "was that I had a mother in the spirit world. She died when I was 14 months old. . . ." Later on, he spoke of the time when he had the opportunity to have his mother sealed to his father: "She will have a part in the first resurrection; and this alone would pay me for all the labors of my life" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Wilford Woodruff [2011], 185–86).</p>

<heading>Our trials can be a blessing.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Maybe there's someone in your class experiencing a difficult trial. The experiences Paul described and the counsel he gave in 2 Corinthians can help class members think about the blessings that can come from their trials. To start a discussion, you might ask a class member to come prepared to talk about how a trial blessed his or her life or what he or she learned from someone else who endured a trial. Then you could give class members a few minutes to review 2 Corinthians 1:3–7; 4:6–10, 17–18; and 7:4–7, looking for what Paul taught about the purposes and blessings of trials. (For examples of his teachings, see this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.) Ask class members to share what they find. You might suggest that they read aloud the verse in which they found a particular teaching and then share an experience or testimony related to that teaching.</li>
<li>Consider giving class members time to ponder how trials can bless our lives, including by reviewing Paul's teachings found in 2 Corinthians 1:3–7; 4:6–10, 17–18; 7:4–7. During this time they could write how Paul's teachings might apply to afflictions they face in their own lives.</li>
<li>To add to your discussion, consider singing together class members' favorite hymns that testify of the comfort and blessings Heavenly Father and the Savior offer us in times of trial — such as "How Firm a Foundation" (Hymns, no. 85). After singing together, you might invite class members to look for a phrase in 2 Corinthians 1 and 4 that they feel fits the message of the hymn.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 CORINTHIANS 2:5–11</heading>
<heading>We receive blessings and bless others when we forgive.</heading>
<ul>
<li>We have all had experiences when someone has "caused grief" to us or our family (verse 5). Perhaps class members could search 2 Corinthians 2:5–11, looking for counsel from Paul about how to treat someone who has offended us. Consider inviting class members to review Luke 15:11–32; John 8:1–11; and the quotation by Elder Kevin R. Duncan in "Additional Resources" to learn more about how we should treat those who have offended us. How do we harm ourselves and others when we are unwilling to forgive?</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 CORINTHIANS 5:14–21</heading>
<heading>Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be reconciled to God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many people come to church with a desire to feel closer to God, and a discussion of 2 Corinthians 5:14–21 can help them. To begin, class members could explore the meaning of the word reconcile, perhaps beginning by looking up the word in a dictionary. What insights does this provide about being reconciled with God? What additional insights do we gain from the entry "Atonement" in the Bible Dictionary? How do these insights help us understand 2 Corinthians 5:14–21? You may want to invite class members to share their feelings about the Savior, whose Atonement makes it possible for us to be reunited with God.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 CORINTHIANS 7:8–11</heading>
<heading>Godly sorrow leads to repentance.</heading>
<ul>
<li>2 Corinthians 7:8–11 gives a helpful explanation of godly sorrow and its role in repentance. What do we learn about godly sorrow from 2 Corinthians 7:8–11 and President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's words in "Additional Resources"? Why is godly sorrow essential to repentance?</li>
<li>You might feel impressed to encourage a broader discussion about repentance. If so, you could try something like this: Write on the board Repentance is ___. Ask class members to find ways to complete this phrase, using things they learn from 2 Corinthians 7:8–11, as well as from the scriptures and other resources found in "Additional Resources." How might they use these teachings to help someone understand how to sincerely repent?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Ask class members if they have ever prayed to have a trial or affliction removed. In 2 Corinthians 8–13, they will find out how Paul responded when he prayed for this but his prayer was not answered in the way he expected.</p>

<heading>2 Corinthians 1–7</heading>
<heading>Seeing others as God sees them helps us to forgive.</heading>
<p>Elder Kevin R. Duncan taught: "One key to forgiving others is to try to see them as God sees them. At times, God may part the curtain and bless us with the gift to see into the heart, soul, and spirit of another person who has offended us. This insight may even lead to an overwhelming love for that person" ("The Healing Ointment of Forgiveness," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 34).</p>
<heading>Godly sorrow inspires change and hope.</heading>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained:
"Godly sorrow inspires change and hope through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Worldly sorrow pulls us down, extinguishes hope, and persuades us to give in to further temptation.
"Godly sorrow leads to conversion and a change of heart. It causes us to hate sin and love goodness. It encourages us to stand up and walk in the light of Christ's love. True repentance is about transformation, not torture or torment" ("You Can Do It Now!" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 56).</p>

<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen taught:
"When we sin, we turn away from God. When we repent, we turn back toward God.
"The invitation to repent is rarely a voice of chastisement but rather a loving appeal to turn around and to «re-turn» toward God [see Helaman 7:17]. It is the beckoning of a loving Father and His Only Begotten Son to be more than we are, to reach up to a higher way of life, to change, and to feel the happiness of keeping the commandments. Being disciples of Christ, we rejoice in the blessing of repenting and the joy of being forgiven. They become part of us, shaping the way we think and feel. . . .
"For most, repentance is more a journey than a one-time event. It is not easy. To change is difficult. It requires running into the wind, swimming upstream. Jesus said, «If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me» [Matthew 16:24]. Repentance is turning away from some things, such as dishonesty, pride, anger, and impure thoughts, and turning toward other things, such as kindness, unselfishness, patience, and spirituality. It is «re-turning» toward God" ("Repent. . . That I May Heal You," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 40–41).</p>

<heading>Saints cheerfully share what they have to bless the poor and needy.</heading>
<ul>
<li>God has commanded His Saints to help take care of those in need, and passages in 2 Corinthians 8–9 can inspire your class members in their efforts. To help them find these passages, you could write on the board questions like<i>Why do we give?</i>and<i>How should we give?</i>Half of the class could search for answers in 2 Corinthians 8:1–15, and the other half could search in 2 Corinthians 9:6–15. (You might explain that in chapter 8, verses 1–5, Paul spoke of the Macedonian Saints as examples of generous giving.) How might the principles taught by Paul help us better care for the poor and needy?</li>
<li>There are many resources listed in "Additional Resources" that can help class members better understand the Lord's way of meeting the temporal needs of His Saints. Perhaps you could assign a few class members to review one or more of these resources and share what impresses them. Can class members find ideas in 2 Corinthians 8:1–15; 9:6–15 showing that the Saints in Paul's time cared for the poor in the same ways we do today?</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 CORINTHIANS 11:13–33</heading>
<heading>False prophets seek to deceive.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Because we, like the Corinthian Saints, are all susceptible to false teachings, we can benefit from reviewing Paul's warnings to the Corinthians about "false apostles." Class members might find examples of false teachings that influence us today in Elder Quentin L. Cook's message "Valiant in the Testimony of Jesus" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 40–43). Perhaps you could assign someone to read this message beforehand and share with the class what it teaches about how we can avoid "stumbling blocks" that lead us away from the gospel. What other teachings common in the world today can lead us away from the truths of the gospel? You might ask class members to review 2 Corinthians 11:21–33 and share what they learn from these verses about true "ministers of Christ."</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 CORINTHIANS 11:3; 13:5–8</heading>
<heading>We should "examine" our faithfulness in the gospel of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes Church members feel overwhelmed O with the demands of life — including what they might see as the demands of being a Latter-day Saint. Paul's counsel to "examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith" can help you and your class members focus on "the simplicity that is in Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:3; 13:5). Perhaps you could read together 2 Corinthians 11:3 and discuss what the phrase "simplicity that is in Christ" might mean. You could also ask class members to imagine that they were invited to write a description of the gospel of Jesus Christ for a newspaper, with a limit of 100 words. Give them time to write simple descriptions, and let them share with each other what they wrote. If they need help, they might refer to Jo your class members focus on "the simplicity that is in Christ" (2 Corinthians 11:3; 13:5). Perhaps you could read together 2 Corinthians 11:3 and discuss what the phrase "simplicity that is in Christ" might mean. You could also ask class members to imagine that they were invited to write a description of the gospel of Jesus Christ for a newspaper, with a limit of 100 words. Give them time to write simple descriptions, and let them share with each other what they wrote. If they need help, they might refer to John 3:16–17; 3 Nephi 27:13–21; and True to the Faith, 76. Invite class members to ponder whether they are staying true to the fundamental principles of the gospel.</li>
<li>To help class members "examine" how they could simplify their lives to be better disciples, you might share with them President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's statement in "Additional Resources." Class members could discuss how they can apply President Uchtdorf's invitation to "focus on the basic doctrines, principles, and applications of the gospel." What other ideas do class members have about how we can examine ourselves to ensure that we remain true to the faith?</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 CORINTHIANS 12:5–10</heading>
<heading>The Savior's grace is sufficient to help us find strength in our weakness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What would you say to a friend who has prayed for relief from a trial but feels that this prayer is not being answered? Consider inviting class members to ponder this question as they silently read 2 Corinthians 12:5–10. Then they could share insights from these verses that might help in this situation. They could also share experiences when, through Jesus Christ's grace, they found strength in weakness. How did that experience influence their lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage your class members to read Galatians, you might ask them if they know anyone who has strayed from the gospel. If so, they will want to read how Paul invited the Galatians who had strayed from the gospel to come back.</p>

<heading>We can simplify our approach to living the gospel.</heading>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:
"Brothers and sisters, living the gospel doesn't need to be complicated.
"It is really straightforward. It could be described like this:
<ul>
<li>"Hearing the word of God with earnest intent leads us to believe in God and to trust His promises.</li>
<li>"The more we trust God, the more our hearts are filled with love for Him and for each other.</li>
<li>"Because of our love for God, we desire to follow Him and bring our actions in alignment with His word.</li>
<li>"Because we love God, we want to serve Him; we want to bless the lives of others and help the poor and the needy.</li>
<li>"The more we walk in this path of discipleship, the more we desire to learn the word of God.</li>
</ul>
"And so it goes, each step leading to the next and filling us with ever-increasing faith, hope, and charity. "It is beautifully simple, and it works beautifully. "Brothers and sisters, if you ever think that the gospel isn't working so well for you, I invite you to step back, look at your life from a higher plane, and simplify your approach to discipleship. Focus on the basic doctrines, principles, and applications of the gospel. I promise that God will guide and bless you on your path to a fulfilling life, and the gospel will definitely work better for you" ("It Works Wonderfully!" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 22).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Work together with family members.</b>"The people who have the most powerful influence on an individual for good or ill — are usually those in his or her home. Because the home is the center of gospel living and learning, your efforts to strengthen a class member will be most effective when you work together with. . . his or her family members" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 8).</p>

<heading>Galatians</heading>
<heading>"Walk in the Spirit"</heading>
<p>As you prayerfully read and ponder Galatians, the Lord will teach you what you need to share with your class. Recording your impressions shows gratitude to God for His help (see Paul B. Pieper, "To Hold Sacred," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 109).</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Scripture study often leads to meaningful gospel discussions with family or friends. Did this happen for members of your class this week? Invite them to share their experiences.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>GALATIANS 1:6–7; 3:1–5; 4:8–21; 5:1, 13–14</heading>
<heading>The gospel of Jesus Christ offers liberty.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying any book of scripture is easier when we know why it was written. For this reason, it might be good to begin your discussion about Galatians with a question like "What do you think Paul's purpose was in writing this epistle?" or "What problem was Paul trying to solve?" Invite class members to look for clues in Galatians 1:6–7; 3:1–5; 4:8–21. How is Paul's message relevant to us today?</li>
<li>Some Galatian Saints thought they needed to continue living the law of Moses. To Paul, this was like living with a "yoke of bondage" compared to the liberty offered in the law of Christ (Galatians 5:1). While we do not commonly face this problem today, we all face a similar choice between spiritual bondage and liberty through Jesus Christ. To help members of your class explore Paul's teachings about freedom and bondage, you could ask them to name attitudes and actions that might lead to spiritual bondage (such as cultural practices, bad habits, false beliefs, or focusing on outward actions rather than inward conversion). According to Galatians 5:1, 13–14, how do we find freedom from spiritual bondage? How have class members experienced the liberty promised in the gospel of Christ? You could also invite class members to share how they might respond to someone who feels that living the gospel limits personal freedom.</li>
</ul>
<heading>GALATIANS 5:16–26</heading>
<heading>If we "walk in the Spirit," we will receive the "fruit of the Spirit."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many people struggle to recognize the influence of the Spirit. Galatians 5 can help members of your class recognize the fruit of the Spirit. Maybe you could start by asking them to search Galatians 5:22–25 to find the words Paul used to describe the fruit of the Spirit. Why is fruit a good metaphor for the way the Spirit influences us? Perhaps class members could share how this fruit has been evident in their lives or the lives of people they know. Some other resources to explore include Matthew 7:16–18; John 14:26–27; Moroni 7:13–17; Doctrine and Covenants 11:12–13; and the statements by President Gordon B. Hinckley in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>We can receive the "fruit of the Spirit" as we seek it.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes we can learn about a principle by learning about its opposite. For example, in Galatians 5:16–26, Paul contrasted "the works of the flesh" with "the fruit of the Spirit." To help class members ponder to what degree they "walk in the Spirit," you might suggest that they read Galatians 5:16–26 and then create a personal assessment similar to the Attribute Activity on page 126 of Preach My Gospel. For example, for each item listed in verses 19–23, they could write a question such as "Do I envy my peers?" or "Do I feel love every day?" Class members' answers to their self-assessments should not be shared, but you could invite them to share ideas or thoughts to help each other "walk in the Spirit." If you don't have time to finish this activity in class, you could suggest that class members complete it at home.</li>
</ul>
<heading>GALATIANS 6:7–10</heading>
<heading>When we sow "to the Spirit," we will reap blessings in due time.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying Galatians 6:7–10 could help class members think more deeply about the long-term consequences of their choices. To help them, you could bring seeds of various kinds, along with plants, fruits, or vegetables that grow from each of these seeds (or you could bring pictures of these things). Class members could work together to match each seed with the thing it produces. Then they could read verses 7–10 and talk about what it means to sow "to [the] flesh" and "to the Spirit." (The message from Elder Ulisses Soares in "Additional Resources" might help.) What do we reap when we sow to the flesh? What do we reap when we sow to the Spirit? (see Galatians 5:22–23). Consider inviting class members to ponder the spiritual blessings they hope to receive. What "sowing" can they do now to be prepared to receive those blessings? You might even invite them to write down their thoughts and, if they feel comfortable, to share them.</li>
<li>Some class members may feel "weary in well doing" (Galatians 6:9) — perhaps because they aren't sure their efforts are bearing fruit. A discussion of Galatians 6:7–10 might be helpful. To introduce these verses, you could invite someone in the class to talk briefly about a time when he or she needed patience when trying to grow something. What could this person's experience, along with Galatians 6:7–10, teach us about our efforts to "walk in the Spirit"? (Galatians 5:25).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage your class members to read the Epistle to the Ephesians, you could tell them that in this epistle they will learn how they can "stand against the wiles of the devil" (Ephesians 6:11).</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Galatians</heading>
<heading>The fruits of gospel living.</heading>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: "How do we know the things of the Spirit? How do we know that it is from God? By the fruits of it. If it leads to growth and development, if it leads to faith and testimony, if it leads to a better way of doing things, if it leads to godliness, then it is of God. If it tears us down, if it brings us into darkness, if it confuses us and worries us, if it leads to faithlessness, then it is of the devil."
On another occasion, President Hinckley said: "You recognize the promptings of the Spirit by the fruits of the Spirit that which enlighteneth, that which buildeth up, that which is positive and affirmative and uplifting and leads us to better thoughts and better words and better deeds is of the Spirit of God. That which tears down, which leads us into forbidden paths — that is of the adversary. I think it is just that plain, just that simple" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Gordon B. Hinckley [2016], 121).</p>
<heading>Sowing in the Spirit.</heading>
<p>Elder Ulisses Soares explained: "To sow in the Spirit means that all our thoughts, words, and actions must elevate us to the level of the divinity of our heavenly parents. However, the scriptures refer to the flesh as the physical or carnal nature of the natural man, which allows people to be influenced by passion, desires, appetites, and drives of the flesh instead of looking for inspiration from the Holy Ghost. If we are not careful, those influences together with the pressure of the evil in the world may conduct us to adopt vulgar and reckless behavior which may become part of our character" ("Abide in the Lord's Territory!" Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 39).</p>

<heading>EPHESIANS 2:19–22; 4:4–8, 11–16</heading>
<heading>Prophets and apostles — and all of us — strengthen and unify the Church.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Could you and your class build something together to illustrate how the Church is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets" and how the Savior is "the chief corner stone"? (Ephesians 2:20).</li>
<li>Perhaps class members could label blocks or paper cups and assemble them into a tower or pyramid, with Jesus Christ and the apostles and prophets forming the base. Then you could demonstrate what would happen if Christ or the apostles and prophets were removed. Why is the chief cornerstone a good metaphor for Jesus Christ and His role in the Church? (For a description of a chief cornerstone, see "Additional Resources.") Class members could search Ephesians 2:19–22; 4:11–16 for blessings we receive because of apostles, prophets, and other Church leaders. What can we do to build our lives on their teachings?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of the Church.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>To demonstrate how doctrine can be misunderstood without continual direction from prophets and apostles, you could play a game in which you tell a short story to one class member without letting anyone else hear. Then invite that class member to repeat the story to another class member and so on until the story has been passed through several individuals. Then ask the last person who hears the story to tell the rest of the class what he or she heard. Did any details of the story change? What would have happened if the teacher could have corrected mistakes along the way? What does this activity teach us about why Christ's Church must be "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets"?</li>
<li>If members of your class listened to general conference since the last time you met, invite them to share how the things taught during conference helped fulfill the purposes stated in Ephesians 4:11–16.</li>
<li>Perhaps you could give class members a moment to list some of the "vocations" or responsibilities they have been called to fulfill at church (see Ephesians 4:1) — for example, a home or visiting teacher, a parent, a disciple of Christ, and so on. Then they could exchange lists with another class member, read Ephesians 4:4–8, 11–16, and share how the callings and assignments on their lists help edify the body of Christ. How can we work together to become unified under "one Lord, one faith, one baptism"?</li>
</ul>
<heading>EPHESIANS 5:22–6:4</heading>
<heading>Following the Savior's example can strengthen family relationships.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Although the Ephesians lived in a culture in which wives were not treated as equals to their husbands, this epistle still contains some valuable counsel for married couples today. You might write questions like the following on the board and invite class members to discuss them as they read Ephesians 5:22–33 in groups: How did Christ show His love for the Church? What can we do to follow His example in how we treat our spouses? You might invite class members to share examples they've seen of spouses acting in Christlike ways toward each other. How can we apply these principles to other family relationships?</li>
<li>While Paul's counsel to "honour thy father and mother" (Ephesians 6:2) was addressed to children, it can apply to each of us, regardless of our age or family situation. Invite class members to think about how they can apply Paul's counsel in Ephesians 6:1–3 to their own circumstances. For example, how can we honor our parents even if their choices don't align with the teachings of Jesus Christ? You might give class members a few minutes to write down what they can do to better honor their parents.</li>
<li>If there are parents — or future parents — of young children in your class, they might benefit from discussing Ephesians 6:4. What does it mean to bring up children "in the nurture and admonition of the Lord"? Perhaps class members who have older children could share what this means to them and how they have tried to apply this counsel in their families.</li>
</ul>
<heading>EPHESIANS 6:10–18</heading>
<heading>The armor of God will help protect us from evil.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What would help inspire class members to strive to put on the whole armor of God each day? You could prepare an activity in which class members match pieces of armor with the principles or virtues they represent in Ephesians 6:14–17. How can each piece of armor help protect us from wickedness? (For some help, see "Additional Resources.") How have class members put on this armor? As part of this discussion, you might share President N. Eldon Tanner's explanation in "Additional Resources." What can we do to identify and strengthen any weaknesses in our armor?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Philippians and Colossians, you could tell them that one of the Articles of Faith is based on a verse found in one of these epistles. Can they find it in their studies this week?</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Ephesians</heading>
<heading>What is a chief cornerstone?</heading>
<p>The chief cornerstone is the first stone placed in a foundation. It serves as a reference point for the measurement and placement of the other stones, which must be aligned with the chief cornerstone. Because it bears the weight of the rest of the building, the chief cornerstone must be solid, stable, and reliable (see "The Cornerstone," Ensign, Jan. 2016, 74–75).</p>
<heading>The armor of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li><b>Loins girt about with truth:</b>This piece of armor is like a belt tied around the waist. The word<i>girt</i>can also mean fortified, strengthened, or reinforced.</li>
<li><b>Breastplate:</b>A breastplate protects the heart and other vital organs.</li>
<li><b>Feet shod:</b>This refers to protective covering for a soldier's feet.</li>
<li><b>Shield:</b>A shield can protect almost any part of the body from a variety of attacks.</li>
<li><b>Helmet:</b>A helmet protects the head.</li>
<li><b>Sword:</b>A sword allows us to take action against the enemy.</li>
</ul>
<heading>"Examine your armor."</heading>
<p>President N. Eldon Tanner, who served as a counselor in the First Presidency, invited members of the Church to evaluate the strength of their personal armor by pondering their efforts to live the gospel. He then explained:
"If. . . our armor is weak, there is an unshielded place which can be found, a vulnerable area for attack, and we will be subject to injury or destruction by Satan, who will search until he finds our weaknesses, if we have them.
"Examine your armor. Is there an unguarded or unprotected place? Determine now to add whatever part is missing. No matter how antiquated or lacking in parts your armor may be, always remember that it is within your power to make the necessary adjustments to complete your armor.
"Through the great principle of repentance you can turn your life about and begin now clothing yourself with the armor of God through study, prayer, and a determination to serve God and keep his commandments" ("Put on the Whole Armor of God," Ensign, May 1979, 46).</p>

<heading>PHILIPPIANS 2:1–5, 14–18; 4:1–9; COLOSSIANS 3:1–17</heading>
<heading>Disciples of Jesus Christ become "new" as they live His gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You may want to help your class members visualize what it means to "put off the old man" and "put on the new man" through Jesus Christ (Colossians 3:9–10). To do this, you might display something old and something new (such as overripe and fresh fruit or an old and new article of clothing). Class members could discuss how we become "new" through our faith in Jesus Christ and our willingness to live His gospel. As part of this discussion, you could ask half of the class to study Philippians 2:1–5, 14–18; 4:1–9 and the other half to study Colossians 3:1–17, identifying characteristics of the "old man" and the "new man." You could also invite a few class members to share how having faith in Jesus Christ and living His gospel have helped them become new people. Other scriptures you could explore together include Romans 6:3–7; Mosiah 3:19; and Alma 5:14, 26.</li>
</ul>
<heading>PHILIPPIANS 4:1–13</heading>
<heading>We can find joy in Christ, regardless of our circumstances.</heading>
<ul>
<li><p>Even though our circumstances are different from Paul's, we can all learn from his willingness to be content and to rejoice in all the circumstances of his life. To begin a discussion on this topic, you could review some of the trials Paul experienced (see, for example, 2 Corinthians 11:23–28). You could then ask class members to review Philippians 4:1–13 to find counsel Paul gave that can help us rejoice, even in times of trial.</p>
<p>If you would like to explore this topic further, you might ask a class member to share some inspiring accounts or statements from President Russell M. Nelson's talk "Joy and Spiritual Survival" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 81–84), or the class could watch the video "Trial of Adversity" (LDS.org). How did the people in President Nelson's talk or the woman in the video find joy, despite their difficult circumstances?</p></li>
<li>Perhaps class members can find counsel in Philippians 4 that can help them when they experience trials. You might give each class member a note card so they can write what they find. Ask them to put it where they will see it when they need it.</li>
<li>Sometimes a hymn can enhance our understanding of the scriptures. For example, after reading Philippians 4:7, 13, you could sing together "Where Can I Turn for Peace?" or the first verse of "Lord, I Would Follow Thee" (Hymns, nos. 129,220). What connections do class members see between the words of these hymns and Philippians 4:7, 13? Perhaps they could share experiences when they felt "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding" or when they felt strengthened "through Christ" to accomplish something they could not have done otherwise. Elder Jay E. Jensen's experience, found in "Additional Resources," might help inspire discussion about these verses.</li>
<li>Because evil is increasing in today's world, your class members will benefit from Paul's counsel to "think on" things that are pure, lovely, of good report, virtuous, or praiseworthy (Philippians 4:8). Perhaps you could assign each class member (or small groups of class members) one of the qualities listed in Philippians 4:8 or Articles of Faith 1:13. They could each use the Topical Guide to find scriptures about their assigned quality and share with the class what they find. They could also share examples of that quality in people's lives. How do we "seek after these things"? .</li>
</ul>
<heading>COLOSSIANS 1:12–23; 2:3–8</heading>
<heading>When our faith is "rooted" in Jesus Christ, we are strengthened against worldly influences.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Paul's testimony of the Savior found in Colossians 1:12–23; 2:3–8 provides a good opportunity for class members to ponder and strengthen their own faith. Class members could search these verses to find things that strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ. What does it mean to be "rooted and built up in [Jesus Christ]"? (Colossians 2:7). The picture of a tree in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me For Individuals and Families and the video "Spiritual Whirlwinds" (LDS.org) can help class members discuss this verse. (See also Neil L. Andersen, "Spiritual Whirlwinds," Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 18–21.) What can strengthen or weaken the roots of a tree? How does being "rooted and built up in [Jesus Christ]" strengthen us against worldly influences? (see Colossians 2:7–8; see also Helaman 5:12; Ether 12:4).</li>
<li>Your class members may be aware of philosophies and traditions of men that can "spoil" a person's faith in Christ because they contradict gospel truths and make gospel living more difficult (Colossians 2:8). Perhaps class members could list some of these (the ideas suggested by Elder Dallin H. Oaks, found in "Additional Resources," might help). Then you could discuss how being rooted in the teachings of Jesus Christ helps us follow Paul's counsel: "As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him" (Colossians 2:6). How can we support each other in our efforts to follow the Savior and not false worldly traditions?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>

<heading>Peace that passes all understanding</heading>
<p>While serving as a member of the Seventy, Elder Jay E. Jensen shared this experience:
"Our grandson Quinton was born with multiple birth defects and lived three weeks short of a year, during which time he was in and out of the hospital. Sister Jensen and I were living in Argentina at that time. We truly wanted to be there with our children to comfort them and be comforted by them. This was our grandchild whom we loved and wanted to be near. We could only pray, and we did so fervently!
"Sister Jensen and I were on a mission tour when we received word Quinton had died. We stood in the hallway of a meetinghouse and hugged and comforted each other. I witness to you that assurances came to us from the Holy Ghost, a peace which passes all understanding and continues to this day (see Philippians 4:7). We also witnessed the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost in the lives of our son and daughter-in-law and their children, who to this day speak of that time with such faith, peace, and comfort" ("The Holy Ghost and Revelation," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 78).</p>

<p>Elder Dallin H. Oaks identified several worldly traditions that contradict gospel truths (see "Repentance and Change," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2003, 37–40):
<ul>
<li>Disregard for the law of chastity</li>
<li>Irregular and passive church attendance</li>
<li>Violations of the Word of Wisdom</li>
<li>Dishonesty</li>
<li>Aspiring for "promotions" in Church positions</li>
<li>A culture of dependency rather than individual responsibility</li>
</ul>
</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Use music.</b>Sacred music invites the influence of the Holy Ghost. It can create a reverent atmosphere and inspire commitment and action. Consider how "teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns" can be part of your class (Colossians 3:16; see also Teaching in the Savior's Way, 22).</p>

<heading>1 and 2 Thessalonians</heading>
<heading>"Be Not Soon Shaken in Mind, or Be Troubled"</heading>
<p>Alma taught, "Trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments" (Mosiah 23:14). What does this scripture suggest about how you should prepare yourself to teach?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Give class members a few minutes to quickly look over 1 and 2 Thessalonians and find a verse that impresses them. Invite them to share their verses with someone else in the class, and then ask a few of the pairs to share what they learned from each other.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>1 THESSALONIANS 1:5–8; 2:1–13</heading>
<heading>Ministers of the gospel preach with sincerity and love.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Paul began his Epistle to the Thessalonians by reminding the Saints of the manner in which he and others had shared the gospel with them. This may be a good opportunity for your class members to evaluate how they are doing at teaching and learning from one another. You could invite class members to read 1 Thessalonians 1:5–8; 2:1–13 and identify principles related to sharing the gospel effectively. They could then write questions based on these verses that will help them evaluate their efforts to teach the gospel to others. For instance, one question might be "Am I an example of the things I know?" (see 1 Thessalonians 1:7). How can following the principles in this passage help us better minister to those we teach?</li>
<li>Reading 1 Thessalonians 1:5–8; 2:1–13 might remind class members of Christlike teachers who have positively influenced them "as a father doth his children" (1 Thessalonians 2:11). Invite class members to search these passages to find a characteristic of a sincere minister and think of a teacher they know who exemplifies that characteristic. You might ask class members to write a letter or create an award certificate for the teacher they are thinking of. Encourage them to include in the letter or award a verse from 1 Thessalonians and an explanation of how the teacher exemplifies that verse. They may even feel inspired to give the letter or award to the person they wrote about.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 THESSALONIANS 3:9–13; 4:1–12</heading>
<heading>As we follow Jesus Christ, we can become holy.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Paul taught the Thessalonian Saints that "God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness" (1 Thessalonians 4:7). To begin a discussion about holiness, your class or an individual could sing "More Holiness Give Me" (Hymns, no. 131). Ask class members to discuss the characteristics of holiness mentioned in the hymn that stand out to them. Write on the board<i>More holiness give me, more. . .,</i>and invite class members to look for words or phrases from 1 Thessalonians 3:9–13; 4:1–12 to complete the sentence. How can we develop these characteristics?</li>
<li>For some, the invitation to be holy might seem daunting. It might help if class members understand that developing holiness is a gradual process that requires us to "increase more and more" over time (1 Thessalonians 4:10). To illustrate this process, you could invite a class member to talk about a talent or accomplishment that took consistent effort over time, such as making a quilt or playing a musical instrument. How is this similar to the process of becoming holy? Invite class members to review 1 Thessalonians 3:9–13; 4:1–12 and share insights about the effort it takes to become holy in the ways Paul describes. What has helped us progress toward holiness?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 THESSALONIANS 4:11–12; 2 THESSALONIANS 3:7–13</heading>
<heading>We should work to provide for ourselves and those in need.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Questions like the following could inspire a discussion about Paul's counsel regarding work: What are the consequences of idleness? What do you think Paul meant by the words "quiet" and "quietness"? (1 Thessalonians 4:11; 2 Thessalonians 3:12). You might want to write questions like these on the board for class members to ponder as they read 1 Thessalonians 4:11–12 and 2 Thessalonians 3:7–13. Invite them to discuss these questions in pairs, in small groups, or as a class. What other scriptures help us understand the importance of work and the perils of idleness? (see the suggestions in "Additional Resources").</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 THESSALONIANS 2</heading>
<heading>An apostasy was to precede the Second Coming of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the Great Apostasy can strengthen your class members' testimonies of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ. This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families includes several resources about the Apostasy. You could invite a few class members to come prepared to share insights from their study of these resources, or you could study and discuss them together in class. There are also several videos about the Apostasy in "Additional Resources" that might add to your discussion.</li>
<li>It might be helpful to discuss some of the metaphors prophets have used to describe the Apostasy, such as a falling away (see 2 Thessalonians 2:3), a famine (see Amos 8:11–12), grievous wolves entering a flock (see Acts 20:28–30), and itching ears (see 2 Timothy 4:3–4). Consider dividing class members into pairs and asking them to read one or more of these scriptures (or others that you choose) and describe what the verses teach about the Great Apostasy. What did prophets teach about the Apostasy and the effect it would have?</li>
<li>To help class members learn more about the Great Apostasy, invite them to imagine that they have a friend who doesn't understand the need for a restoration of the gospel. Create a two-column chart on the board labeled<i>Causes of the Apostasy</i>and<i>Effects of the Apostasy.</i>Invite class members to search the section titled "The Great Apostasy" in Preach My Gospel (pages 35–36) in pairs or small groups, looking for causes and effects of the Apostasy to write on the board. What insights from this chart could they use to help their friend understand the need for the Restoration?</li>
<li>Would your class benefit from discussing how to keep ourselves from "falling away"? You might invite them to search 2 Thessalonians 2 and look for advice they could give a friend that would help him or her avoid personal apostasy.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon this week, invite them to imagine that they received a personal letter from an Apostle containing advice about how to fulfill their Church callings. Suggest that they think about their callings as they read these personal letters from Paul to early Church leaders.</p>

<p><b>Use a variety of methods.</b>It can be easy to get comfortable with one particular style of teaching, but different teaching methods reach different class members. Look for ways to vary your teaching approach, such as using videos, artwork, or music or giving class members opportunities to teach (see Teaching in the Savior's Way, 22).</p>

<heading>1 and 2 Timothy; Titus; Philemon</heading>
<heading>"Be Thou an Example of the Believers"</heading>
<p>Read 1 and 2 Timothy; Titus; and Philemon with your class members in mind. The thoughts and impressions that come will help you direct class members to relevant scripture passages and bring the Spirit into your classroom.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>It can be helpful for class members to hear each other talk about their successes and challenges with studying the scriptures, both individually and as families. Consider starting the class by inviting class members to talk about what is going well in their scripture study.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>1 AND 2 TIMOTHY; TITUS</heading>
<heading>Understanding true doctrine will help us avoid being deceived.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The members of your class are living in a time when many false doctrines are being taught. Timothy and Titus also lived in such a time, so perhaps Paul's counsel to them could benefit your class members. Some passages containing this counsel are found in "Additional Resources." You could assign each class member to read one of these passages and share what he or she learns about the importance of true doctrine (see also Alma 31:5).</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 TIMOTHY 4:10–16</heading>
<heading>If we are "example[s] of the believers," we can lead others to the Savior and His gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It's possible that members of your class don't realize the power of the good example they are setting. Consider inviting them to talk about how people they know, including fellow class members, have been examples of disciples of Christ. It might help the discussion if you list on the board the words in verse 12 that describe how we should be an example — word, conversation (which can also mean conduct or behavior), charity, spirit, faith, and purity. Class members could discuss how we can be examples of the believers in each of these ways.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 TIMOTHY 1</heading>
<heading>"God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."</heading>
<ul>
<li>In this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families, your class members were invited to look in 2 Timothy for counsel Paul gave Timothy to encourage him in his ministry. Ask class members to share any insights they found, or maybe you could give them a few minutes to find and share some of Paul's counsel (chapter 1 has some good examples). They could also share an experience when God helped them overcome their fears and gave them "the spirit of . . . power, and of love, and of a sound mind" (2 Timothy 1:7).</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 TIMOTHY 3</heading>
<heading>Studying the scriptures can help us overcome the perils of the last days.</heading>
<ul>
<li>After warning Timothy about "perilous times" to come, Paul testified of the power and importance of the scriptures (see 2 Timothy 3:1, 14–17). To begin a discussion about the importance of the scriptures in difficult times, you could invite class members to review Paul's description of the perils of the last days found in 2 Timothy 3:1–7. Then they could search for and share scriptures that have helped them guard against perils like these (some examples are listed in "Additional Resources"). How has our study of the scriptures protected us from troubles in today's world?</li>
<li>Studying Paul's counsel about the power of the scriptures could be an opportunity for class members to encourage each other in their efforts to study the word of God. Perhaps class members could read 2 Timothy 3:14–17 and identify the blessings and protections that come from studying the scriptures. Then they could share experiences when these blessings were fulfilled in their lives because of their scripture study. You could also give class members a few moments to ponder what they can do to have more meaningful experiences with the scriptures, both individually and as families.</li>
</ul>
<heading>PHILEMON</heading>
<heading>Followers of Christ forgive one another.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Before you start a discussion about the Epistle to Philemon, you might ask a class member to share some information about Philemon and his servant Onesimus (there is a brief description in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families). Then you could divide your class into two groups and give each group one of the following questions: What similarities do you see between what Paul was willing to do for Onesimus and what the Savior willingly did for us? While it was likely hard for Philemon to forgive his slave who ran away, how would the gospel of Jesus Christ have made forgiveness easier? After the groups share what they learned, consider inviting class members to share scripture passages or experiences that have helped them to better understand forgiveness. Elder Kevin R. Duncan's message in "Additional Resources" may help with this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read the Epistle to the Hebrews, ask them if they know someone who feels that God is distant, impersonal, or unapproachable. Tell them they will find verses in Hebrews 1–6 that they could share with someone to show that God the Father and Jesus Christ are compassionate Beings who want to help us when we suffer.</p>

<heading>The healing ointment of the Savior's Atonement helps us forgive others.</heading>
<p>Elder Kevin R. Duncan taught:
"There is not a soul alive who will not, at one time or another, be the victim to someone else's careless actions, hurtful conduct, or even sinful behavior. This is one thing we all have in common.
"Gratefully, God, in His love and mercy for His children, has prepared a way to help us navigate these sometimes turbulent experiences of life. He has provided an escape for all who fall victim to the misdeeds of others. He has taught us that we can forgive!. . .
"Many years ago, while I was mending a fence, a small sliver of wood entered into my finger. I made a meager attempt to remove the sliver and thought I had done so, but apparently I had not. As time went on, skin grew over the sliver, creating a lump on my finger. It was annoying and sometimes painful.
"Years later I decided to finally take action. All I did was simply apply ointment to the lump and cover it with a bandage. I repeated this process frequently. You cannot imagine my surprise when one day, as I removed the bandage, the sliver had emerged from my finger.
"The ointment had softened the skin and created an escape for the very thing that had caused pain for so many years. Once the sliver was removed, the finger quickly healed, and to this day, there remains no evidence any injury.
"In a similar way, an unforgiving heart harbors so much needless pain. When we apply the healing ointment of the Savior's Atonement, He will soften our heart and help us to change. He can heal the wounded soul (see Jacob 2:8)" ("The Healing Ointment of Forgiveness," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 33).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Spiritual growth occurs at home.</b>You are with your class members for only a short time each Sunday. During the rest of the week, many of them have meaningful spiritual experiences. Ask questions that encourage them to share what they have learned outside of class. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 18.)</p>

<heading>Jesus Christ, "the Author of Eternal Salvation"</heading>
<p>Consider sharing with members of your class some of the impressions you receive from the Holy Ghost about Hebrews 1–6. Doing so may inspire them to seek their own impressions as they study the scriptures.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Some class members who do not share often in class may simply need a specific invitation and a little time to prepare. You could contact a few of them a day or two in advance and ask them to come prepared to share a verse from Hebrews 1–6 that is meaningful to them.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>HEBREWS 1–5</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is "the author of eternal salvation."</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you encourage class members to share meaningful scriptures about Jesus Christ that they found in their personal and family study this week? Consider creating five columns on the board to represent the first five chapters in Hebrews. Invite class members to write in the appropriate column phrases from these chapters that taught them about Jesus Christ and the verse number where they are found. How does knowing these things about the Savior affect our faith in Him and willingness to follow Him?</li>
<li>Hebrews 1–5 uses a variety of images to describe the Savior. Maybe you could use these images to help class members deepen their understanding of His mission. For example, you could contact several class members a few days in advance and ask them to bring to class an object that represents one of these descriptions of Jesus Christ or His mission from Hebrews 1–5 (see especially Hebrews 1:3; 2:10; 3:1, 6; 5:9). They could explain to the class what their objects teach about Jesus Christ and read the corresponding verse from Hebrews. How does knowing these truths about the Savior influence our lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>HEBREWS 2:9–18; 4:12–16; 5:7–8</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ suffered all things so that He can understand and help those who suffer.</heading>
<ul>
<li>There may be members of your class who are suffering trials and sometimes feel forsaken and hopeless. Perhaps a discussion of Hebrews 2:9–18; 4:12–16; 5:7–8 could build their faith that they can turn to Heavenly Father and the Savior for help. One way to start such a discussion is to invite class members to think of someone they know who is suffering and may be losing hope. What truths do they find in these verses that they could share with that person? Class members could also share how the Savior has comforted and supported them. Consider sharing the quotation by President John Taylor in "Additional Resources" as part of the discussion.</li>
<li>Hebrews 2:9–18; 4:12–16 can also help people who observe the suffering in the world and wonder if God notices or even cares. Perhaps class members could search these verses to find truths that would help with such questions. What do they teach about how the Savior responds to humanity's suffering? It may also be helpful to invite class members to share examples from the scriptures where people were supported by Jesus Christ in their sufferings (see "Additional Resources") or show the video "Mountains to Climb" (LDS.org). Discuss together what we learn about how the Savior can help us when we face difficult challenges.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HEBREWS 3:7–4:2</heading>
<heading>God's blessings are available to those who "harden not [their] hearts."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Hebrews 3 and 4 contain a plea to the Saints not to harden their hearts and thereby reject the blessings God wanted to give them. As you and your class read Hebrews 3:7–4:2, discuss ways the experiences of the ancient Israelites could apply to us today, just as they applied to the Hebrews in the early Church (consider referring to the study material about these verses in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families). What is causing people to harden their hearts in our day? What can we do to keep our hearts soft and responsive to the will of the Lord? (see Ether 4:15; Alma 5:14–15).</li>
</ul>
<heading>HEBREWS 5:1–5</heading>
<heading>Those who serve in God's kingdom must be called of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Not all members of your class are priesthood holders, but the message from Hebrews 5 about priesthood holders being called of God applies to all who receive Church callings. To help your class learn what it means to "be called of God as was Aaron," consider inviting them to review the account of Aaron receiving his calling in Exodus 4:10–16, 27–31; 28:1. What insights from this account help us understand Hebrews 5:1–5? When have class members, including ward leaders, received confirmation that someone was called of God to fulfill a specific calling? How did that confirmation help them better sustain someone in their calling? (You may want to ask class members not to disclose sensitive details.) There may also be class members who could testify that God inspired them as they fulfilled their own callings.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Have your class members ever felt like they were "strangers and pilgrims on the earth" (Hebrews 11:13) because their beliefs were different from those around them? Tell them that as they read Hebrews 7–13, they will find examples of individuals who faithfully received and embraced the promises of God even though many around them were faithless.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Hebrews 1–6</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ knows what it's like to experience suffering.</heading>
<p>President John Taylor taught: "It was necessary when the Savior was upon the earth, that he «should be tempted in all points like unto us,» and «be touched with the feelings of our infirmities,» [see Hebrews 4:15] to comprehend the weaknesses and strength; the perfections and imperfections of poor fallen human nature; and having accomplished the thing he came into the world to do, having had to grapple with the hypocrisy, corruption, weakness, and imbecility of man—having met with temptation and trial in all its various forms, and overcome, he has become «A faithful high priest» [see Hebrews 2:17] to intercede for us in the everlasting kingdom of his Father. He knows how to estimate, and put a proper value upon human nature, for he, having been placed in the same position as we were, knows how to bear with our weaknesses and infirmities, and can fully comprehend the depth, power, and strength of the afflictions and trials that men have to cope with in this world, and thus understandingly and by experience, he can bear with them as a father and an elder brother" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: John Taylor [2001], 204–5).</p>
<heading>Scriptural examples of people comforted by Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>John 8:1–11: The Lord comforted the woman taken in adultery.</li>
<li>John 11:1–46: The Lord comforted Mary and Martha after the death of their brother, Lazarus.</li>
<li>Enos 1:4–6: The Lord forgave Enos's sins and removed his guilt.</li>
<li>Mosiah 21:5–15: The Lord softened the hearts of the Lamanites so that they eased the burdens of the people of Limhi.</li>
<li>Mosiah 24:14–15: The Lord eased the burdens of Alma's people.</li>
<li>Ether 12:23–29: The Lord's words comforted Moroni.</li>

<heading>Hebrews 7–13</heading>
<heading>"An High Priest of Good Things to Come"</heading>
<p>As you read Hebrews 7–13, ponder what the Lord's message was for the Hebrew Saints. Also look for His messages to you and the people you teach.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Before class, invite a few class members to come prepared to share verses from Hebrews 7–13 that help them "draw near [to God] with a true heart in full assurance of faith" (Hebrews 10:22).</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>HEBREWS 7:1–22</heading>
<heading>Living worthy of the covenants and blessings of the Melchizedek Priesthood leads to exaltation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One way to explore this chapter is to invite class members to write on the board several true statements about the Melchizedek Priesthood (for ideas, they could read "Melchizedek Priesthood" in True to the Faith, 101–2). They could then search Hebrews 7:1–22 for phrases that support the statements on the board. They could also use the Topical Guide or the Guide to the Scriptures to find other supporting scriptures.</li>
<li>In Hebrews 7:11 Paul asked, "What further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?" In other words, why do we need the Melchizedek Priesthood in addition to the Aaronic Priesthood? Perhaps class members could look for possible answers in True to the Faith, "Aaronic Priesthood" and "Melchizedek Priesthood." You might also invite them to consider the blessings we have because of these two priesthoods (see also the quotation by Sister Sheri L. Dew in "Additional Resources"). How have class members experienced these blessings?</li>
</ul>
<heading>HEBREWS 8–10</heading>
<heading>Ancient and modern ordinances point to Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Even though we don't offer animal sacrifices, we do participate in ordinances today that, in a similar way, point our souls to Christ and provide "authorized channels through which the blessings and powers of heaven can flow into our individual lives" (David A. Bednar, "Always Retain a Remission of Your Sins," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 60). Perhaps you could explore together some details about the ancient ordinances described in Hebrews 8–10 and their symbolic meanings. For example, what does the blood of bulls and goats represent? (see Hebrews 9:13–14). Whom does the high priest represent? (see Hebrews 9:24–26). The video "Sacrifice and Sacrament" (LDS.org) could help. How have modern ordinances blessed us and helped point us to Jesus Christ? What can we do to make these ordinances more meaningful and focused on the Savior?</li>
</ul>
<heading>HEBREWS 10:34–38; 11</heading>
<heading>Faith requires trusting in God's promises.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members understand Paul's teachings about faith, you could begin by asking them to think about how they would describe faith in one sentence. Then, read and discuss as a class the definition Paul gave in Hebrew To help class members understand Paul's teachings about faith, you could begin by asking them to think about how they would describe faith in one sentence. Then, read and discuss as a class the definition Paul gave in Hebrews 11:1. You could then divide the class into small groups and assign each group to study one of the people mentioned in Hebrews 11. Class members could use the footnotes or the Guide to the Scriptures to review the person's experiences in the Old Testament, and then a representative from each group could share with the class what the group found. How did these people show that they felt an "assurance of things hoped for"? (Joseph Smith Translation, Hebrews 11:1 [in Hebrews 11:1, footnote b]). What other examples of faithful people can class members share? When have we exercised faith in promises that had not yet been fulfilled?</li>
<li>It might be fun to create a game to help class members learn about faith from Hebrews 11. For example, you could divide the class into two teams and ask questions about faith that are answered in Hebrews 11 (see "Additional Resources" for examples). The first team to find an answer supported by the scriptures receives a point. Ask class members to discuss what they learn from these verses that helps them understand faith better.</li>
<li>After studying Paul's teachings on faith in Hebrews 10:34–38; 11, would class members benefit by learning about faith from other resources? You could assign several class members ahead of time to study a question about faith like the following: What is faith? How do we develop faith? In what ways are we blessed when we exercise our faith? What happens when we choose not to exercise our faith? Then, in class, they could share what they learned. Or you could invite class members to work together in groups to find answers. Some resources they could use might include Alma 32:21–43; Ether 12; "Faith in Jesus Christ," Gospel Topics, topics.lds.org; and Bible Dictionary, "Faith." After class members share what they learned, ask them to consider what they might do to strengthen their faith. Invite a few class members to share their thoughts.</li>
<li>The counsel to the Hebrew Saints who were tempted to "draw back" from their faith can be valuable to class members who may be struggling with their testimonies. To discover this counsel, class members could read Hebrews 10:34–38 and Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's statement in "Additional Resources." Why are people in the world today casting away their confidence (see Hebrews 10:35) in the Lord and His gospel? What can we do to build and maintain faith and confidence to "receive [God's] promise"? (Hebrews 10:36). The videos "Good Things to Come" and "An High Priest of Good Things to Come" (LDS.org) could supplement this discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Class members might be familiar with Joseph Smith's experience reading James 1:5, which led to the First Vision. Invite them to look for new insights about James 1:5 as they read it this week in the context of James's broader message.</p>

<heading>Questions about faith from Hebrews 11.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How does Hebrews 11 define faith? (see verse 1).</li>
<li>What did faith enable Abel to do? (see verse 4).</li>
<li>According to Hebrews 11, what is it impossible to do without faith? (see verse 6).</li>
<li>What did faith inspire Abraham to look for? (see verse 10).</li>
<li>What did Isaac do with his faith? (see verse 20).</li>
<li>What did faith inspire Moses to give up? (see verses 24–27).</li>
</ul>
<heading>The blessings of the Melchizedek Priesthood are available to all.</heading>
<p>Sister Sheri L. Dew, former counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency, said:
"The blessings of the priesthood are available to every righteous man and woman. We may all receive the Holy Ghost, obtain personal revelation, and be endowed in the temple, from which we emerge «armed» with power. The power of the priesthood heals, protects, and inoculates all of the righteous against the powers of darkness" ("It Is Not Good for Man or Woman to Be Alone," Ensign, Nov. 2001, 13).</p>
<heading>"Cast not away therefore your confidence."</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"Sure it is tough — before you join the Church, while you are trying to join, and after you have joined. That is the way it has always been, Paul says, but don't draw back. Don't panic and retreat. Don't lose your confidence. Don't forget how you once felt. Don't distrust the experience you had. . . .
"With any major decision there are cautions and considerations to make, but once there has been illumination, beware the temptation to retreat from a good thing. If it was right when you prayed about it and trusted it and lived for it, it is right now. Don't give up when the pressure mounts. . . . Face your doubts. Master your fears. «Cast not away therefore your confidence.» Stay the course and see the beauty of life unfold for you" ("Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence," Ensign, Mar. 2000, 6–11).</p>

<heading>JAMES 1:5–6</heading>
<heading>When we ask in faith, God gives liberally.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The principles taught in James 1:5–6 led Joseph Smith to a life-changing spiritual experience, and they can bless each of us in some way. Perhaps you could write questions like the following on the board and ask class members to ponder them silently: What influence has James 1:5–6 had in your life? What has Joseph Smith's experience with these verses taught you about seeking wisdom about your own questions? (see Joseph Smith—History 1:10–17). Before reading this outline, read the Epistle of James and pay attention to promptings you receive. What principles do you find that would bless and edify your class members? Refer to this outline for additional teaching ideas. What experiences have taught you that "the testimony of James [is] true"? (Joseph Smith—History 1:26). Invite class members to share thoughts they have after pondering these questions.</li>
<li>Perhaps class members could put James 1:5–6 into their own words. How does this help them understand these verses better?</li>
<li>To help class members remember that God has promised to give liberally to His children when they approach Him in prayer, ask class members to share experiences in which the promise in James 1:5–6 was fulfilled in their lives. What have they learned as they have asked Heavenly Father to confirm their own questions about gospel truths?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JAMES 1:2–4; 5:7–11</heading>
<heading>Patient endurance eventually leads to perfection.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To start a discussion on James's teachings about patience in these verses, you might invite class members to share experiences when they had to be patient and what they learned from that experience. Then they could search James 1:2–4; 5:7–11 for principles that they can apply to their experiences. They might also find applicable principles in the video "Continue in Patience" (LDS.org) or President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's message "Continue in Patience" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2010, 56–59). Why is patience necessary as we strive toward perfection? What has helped class members develop patience in their lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JAMES 1:3–8, 21–25; 2:14–26</heading>
<heading>"Faith without works is dead."</heading>
<ul>
<li>One way to discuss James's teachings about faith and works could be to divide your class into two groups — one to explore why faith requires action and the other why our actions require faith. To do this, they could read Matthew 7:21–23; James 1:6–8, 21–25; 2:14–26; and Joseph Smith—History 1:19. Then each group could share what they found and discuss why both faith and works are necessary.</li>
<li>To help class members ponder more deeply the memorable phrase "Faith without works is dead" (James 2:26), you could write the following sentence on the board: Faith without works is like ___ without ___. Invite class members to think of creative ways to complete the sentence, and let them write their ideas on the board. They might also benefit from doing this activity in pairs or small groups. The story told by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf in "Additional Resources" could add to their understanding of this principle. What can we do to continually act on our faith in Jesus Christ?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JAMES 2:1–9</heading>
<heading>As disciples of Jesus Christ, we should love all people, regardless of their circumstances.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help inspire class members to show Christlike love to everyone regardless of others' situation or outward appearance, you could ask class members to take turns reading verses from James 1:9–11; 2:1–10; 5:1–6. Discuss questions like the following: What does it mean to "have respect to persons"? (James 2:9). Why do we sometimes treat those who have money, fame, or power differently than those who don't? How can we avoid treating others differently based on what their circumstances are? In what way are faithful followers of the Savior really the richest of all? (see James 2:5).</li>
</ul>
<heading>JAMES 3</heading>
<heading>The words we use have the power to hurt or bless others.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The powerful images James used can provide helpful reminders and motivation to use words — both spoken and written — to uplift others. Consider inviting class members to scan James 3 looking for images that describe how language is used to hurt or bless others; some class members might enjoy drawing pictures of these images. How do these images illustrate James's instructions in this chapter? For example, how can our words be like a fire? What images can class members think of to demonstrate the positive power that language can have? You might invite class members to ponder how they can apply James's counsel.</li>
</ul>

<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught:
"There is an old Jewish tale about a soap maker who did not believe in God. One day as he was walking with a rabbi, he said, «There is something I cannot understand. We have had religion for thousands of years. But everywhere you look there is evil, corruption, dishonesty, injustice, pain, hunger, and violence. It appears that religion has not improved the world at all. So I ask you, what good is it?»
"The rabbi did not answer for a time but continued walking with the soap maker. Eventually they approached a playground where children, covered in dust, were playing in the dirt.
"«There is something I don't understand,» the rabbi said. «Look at those children. We have had soap for thousands of years, and yet those children are filthy. What good is soap?»
"The soap maker replied, «But rabbi, it isn't fair to blame soap for these dirty children. Soap has to be used before it can accomplish its purpose.»
"The rabbi smiled and said, «Exactly»" ("The Just Shall Live by Faith," Ensign or Liahona, Apr. 2017, 4).</p>

<heading>"Rejoice with Joy Unspeakable and Full of Glory"</heading>
<p>Remember that your purpose is to teach people, not just present a lesson. As you read the Epistles of Peter, think of individual class members. What principles will help them build their faith?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Write the headings 1 Peter and 2 Peter on the board. Give class members time to review these chapters, and invite them to write under these headings words or phrases from the chapters that they found meaningful. Then use the lists to invite people to share their insights.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>1 PETER 1:3–9; 2:19–24; 3:14–17; 4:12–19</heading>
<heading>I can find joy during times of trial and suffering.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help those you teach better understand and apply Peter's counsel about finding joy in difficult circumstances, you could give class members pieces of paper and ask them to write a phrase from 1 Peter 1:3–9; 2:19–24; 3:14–17; 4:12–19 that could help them in times of trial or difficulty. On the other side of the paper, they could write about a time of trial when they felt peace or joy. A few volunteers could share their phrase and their experience, and then class members could discuss what they learned.</li>
<li>Another way to review Peter's counsel in 1 Peter 1:3–9; 2:19–24; 3:14–17; 4:12–19 is to invite class members to think about someone they know who is experiencing a trial. Give them time in class to write a letter to that person, including truths from these verses that would encourage that person (see also D&amp;C 121:1–8; 123:17). Then class members could talk about the truths they chose.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 PETER 1:13–20; 2:1–12</heading>
<heading>We are called to be "the people of God."</heading>
<ul>
<li>As members of Christ's Church, we are called to follow Jesus Christ. This means that our choices will often differ from those of other people. How can Peter's teachings in 1 Peter 1:13–20; 2:1–12 help those you teach better understand the Savior's mission and desire to be more like Him? Perhaps you could invite class members to search these verses looking for descriptions of what it means to be "the people of God" (1 Peter 2:10) and then discuss what they find. You might explain that the word "peculiar" in 1 Peter 2:9 means "purchased" or "preserved" (see footnote f ). What does this teach us about the way God feels about us and how He wants us to live?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 PETER 3:18–20; 4:6</heading>
<heading>The gospel is preached to the dead so they can be judged justly.</heading>
<ul>
<li><p>The First Epistle of Peter contains one of the few references in the Bible to Jesus Christ's visit to the spirit world after His death — an event that modern revelation helps us understand more fully. To help class members deepen their understanding of the spirit world, you could invite them to read the following scriptures and write what they learn on the board: John 5:25; 1 Peter 3:18–20; 4:6; Alma 40:7–14, 21; Doctrine and Covenants 138:11–32.</p>
<p>The statements provided in "Additional Resources" show that Christ's visit to the spirit world was understood and taught not only by His Apostles but also by early Christian teachers. Understanding that this knowledge was lost during the Great Apostasy and restored in our day can help class members strengthen their testimonies of Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel.</p></li>
<li>Discussing 1 Peter 3:18–20; 4:6 can help inspire class members to more fully participate in family history and temple work. To do this, you could divide the class into three groups and give each group one of the following questions about the redemption of the dead: What is the Savior's role in redeeming the dead? What is the role of those who have died — both the faithful and those who died without a knowledge of the gospel? What is our role? Ask each group to review 1 Peter 3:18–20; 4:6; Doctrine and Covenants 128:17–18; 138:11–32, 57–59, looking for answers to their question. Ask each group to share what they learned, and consider sharing the quotation by Elder D. Todd Christofferson or one of the videos found in "Additional Resources." What blessings have we witnessed as we have participated in bringing salvation to our deceased ancestors?</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 PETER 1:1–11</heading>
<heading>Through the power of Jesus Christ, we can develop our divine natures.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To encourage those you teach in their efforts to become more like Jesus Christ, you could invite them to identify the Christlike qualities described in 2 Peter 1:1–11. Consider writing these qualities on the board and asking class members to define them. Class members could then discuss how developing one quality leads to the development of the other qualities. Provide time for them to ponder which quality they would like to develop more fully (see also Preach My Gospel, 126). The statements provided in "Additional Resources" show that Christ's visit to the spirit world was understood and taught not only by His Apostles but also by early Christian teachers. Understanding that this knowledge was lost during the Great Apostasy and restored in our day can help class members strengthen their testimonies of Joseph Smith and the Restoration of the gospel.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Each Christlike quality we develop helps us weave a spiritual tapestry of discipleship.</graphics-caption>

<p>You may want to explain that class members will study the Epistles of John during the next week. These epistles help to correct false teachings about Jesus Christ and can strengthen our testimonies of the living reality of the Savior.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>1 and 2 Peter</heading>
<heading>The work of redeeming the dead testifies of Christ's mission.</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught:
"Christian theologians have long wrestled with the question, What is the destiny of the countless billions who have lived and died with no knowledge of Jesus? With the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ has come the understanding of how the unbaptized dead are redeemed and how God can be «a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also» [Alma 42:15].
"While yet in life, Jesus prophesied that He would also preach to the dead [see John 5:25]. Peter tells us this happened in the interval between the Savior's Crucifixion and Resurrection [see 1 Peter 3:18–19]. President Joseph F. Smith witnessed in vision that the Savior visited the spirit world [see D&amp;C 138:30, 33]. . . .
"Our anxiety to redeem the dead, and the time and resources we put behind that commitment, are, above all, an expression of our witness concerning Jesus Christ. It constitutes as powerful a statement as we can make concerning His divine character and mission. It testifies, first, of Christ's Resurrection; second, of the infinite reach of His Atonement; third, that He is the sole source of salvation; fourth, that He has established the conditions for salvation; and, fifth, that He will come again" ("The Redemption of the Dead and the Testimony of Jesus," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2000, 9–10).</p>
<heading>Writings of early Christian teachers (first to third centuries) about preaching to the dead.</heading>
<p>Origen: "When [Jesus] became a soul [a spirit], without the covering of the body, He dwelt among those souls which were without bodily covering, converting such of them as were willing to Himself" (in The Ante-Nicene Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson [1907], 4:448).</p>
<p>Hermas: "The apostles and the teachers who preached the name of the Son of God, after they had fallen asleep in the power and faith of the Son of God, preached also to them that had fallen asleep before them" (in The Apostolic Fathers, trans. J. B. Lightfoot [1898], 472).</p>

<p><b>Teach the "why."</b>"Sometimes learners — especially youth — wonder how gospel principles relate to them or why they should obey certain commandments.

<heading>Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ are perfect examples of light and love.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you help those you teach recognize Heavenly Father's light and love in their lives? You might begin by writing the words light and love on the board. Ask class members to share the first words that come to mind when they think of these two words. You could divide the class into groups and assign each group one of the following scripture passages: 1 John 1:5–10; 2:3–11; 3:1–3; 4:7–12; 4:16–21; 5:1–3. The groups could search these verses for evidences of God's light and love and for things we can do to show our love for God and His children. Members from each group could then share with the class what they found. You could also invite class members to share experiences when they have felt Heavenly Father's light and love.</li>
<li>How can you help class members ponder spiritual light in their lives? You could invite class members to look at a ceiling light or the light coming through a window and share what they know about physical light. How is physical light like spiritual light? Perhaps you could search Psalm 27:1; John 1:4–5; 1 John 1:5–7; 3 Nephi 11:11; Doctrine and Covenants 88:6–13 and look for additional insights into how God and His Son provide light in our lives. Class members could also share experiences when sought and received spiritual light in their lives.</li>
<li>Class members might enjoy singing together or listening to a song about light, such as "The Lord Is My Light" (Hymns, no. 89). What does the song teach about how the Lord is like a light? The video "Choose the Light" (LDS.org) and the statement by Elder Robert D. Hales in "Additional Resources" could offer further insights about how to gain greater light in our lives.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 JOHN 2:18–23, 26–28; 4:3; 2 JOHN 1:7–11; 3 JOHN 1:9–11; JUDE</heading>
<heading>We must fortify ourselves against false teachings.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some of your class members or their loved ones may be struggling to confront false teachings that threaten their faith. It might help them to learn what John and Jude taught about apostasy. Consider inviting half of the class to search for descriptions of false teachings or apostasy in 1 John 2:18–23, 26–28; 4:3; 2 John 1:7–11; 3 John 1:9–11 and the other half to search for such descriptions in Jude. Or they could look for answers to questions like these: How do John and Jude define an antichrist? (see also Guide to the Scriptures, "Antichrist," scriptures.lds.org). Is there anything in these verses that seems especially applicable to challenges we face today? How can we fortify ourselves against false teachings?</li>
<li>Jude uses interesting imagery to describe false teachers, or those who "speak evil of those things which they know not" (Jude 1:10). You might invite a few class members to draw on the board some of the images described in Jude 1:12–13 while other class members guess which phrase the person is drawing. How do these images represent false teachers and antichrists? For example, how do corrupt practices create "spots in [our] feasts of charity"? What can we do to fortify ourselves against "mockers"? (see Jude 1:18–21). Why might Jude have suggested that we "have compassion" (Jude 1:22) on those who mock the gospel?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 JOHN 5</heading>
<heading>As we exercise faith in Christ and are born of God, we can overcome the world.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One of this week's activities in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests searching 1 John 5 to discover how we can overcome the world. Perhaps you could invite class members to share what they found and write it on the board. (You may want to give them some time in class to briefly review the chapter.) Or you could invite the class to read portions of Elder Neil L. Andersen's message "Overcoming the World" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 58–62) and share what they learn. For example, what insights do they gain from the stories Elder Andersen shares about President David O. McKay and Elder Bruce D. Porter? Maybe class members could share their own examples of people who they feel have made efforts to overcome the world.</li>

<graphics-caption>The gospel of Jesus Christ can help us find peace in a troubled world.</graphics-caption>
<heading>3 JOHN 1:1–4</heading>
<heading>Joy comes as we help others "walk in truth."</heading>
<ul>
<li>There are probably people in your class who can relate to what John was feeling when he said that he had "no greater joy" than hearing that Gaius (one of his "children") was walking in truth. Class members might benefit from hearing each other's experiences. Maybe you could start by reading together 3 John 1:1–4 and the scriptures in "Additional Resources." What do these scriptures teach us about the source of true joy? Class members could talk about how they have felt as parents, missionaries, Church leaders, or teachers when they knew that the people they taught were walking in truth. You might contact a few class members before class and ask them to bring pictures of people they helped bring unto Christ and tell about their experiences.</li>

<heading>Light dispels darkness.</heading>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales taught how we can dispel darkness from our lives and walk in light:
"When I was a boy, I used to ride my bicycle home from basketball practice at night. I would connect a small pear-shaped generator to my bicycle tire. Then as I pedaled, the tire would turn a tiny rotor, which produced electricity and emitted a single, welcome beam of light. It was a simple but effective mechanism. But I had to pedal to make it work! I learned quickly that if I stopped pedaling my bicycle, the light would go out. I also learned that when I was «anxiously engaged» [D&amp;C 58:27] in pedaling, the light would become brighter and the darkness in front of me would be dispelled.
"The generation of spiritual light comes from daily spiritual pedaling. It comes from praying, studying the scriptures, fasting, and serving — from living the gospel and obeying the commandments" ("Out of Darkness into His Marvelous Light," Ensign, May 2002, 71).</p>

<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Pray for your class members.</b>Just as the Savior prayed for Peter (see Luke 22:32), you should pray by name for those you teach, seeking to understand their specific needs.

<p>Receiving spiritual impressions helps you recognize that the Holy Ghost wants to teach you. Recording and following those impressions demonstrates that you value them and desire to receive more.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>As you begin a discussion about Revelation, it may be helpful to invite class members to share any background information they learned about the book of Revelation during their personal or family study. You could review together some of the information provided in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families or read together from the Bible Dictionary entries "John" and "Revelation of John."</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>REVELATION 1</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is the Living Son of the Living God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Since John used imagery and symbolism in Revelation 1 to describe the resurrected Savior and His actions, studying this chapter is a great way to build faith that He lives and that He guides His Church. Perhaps class members could write on the board several phrases from Revelation 1 that include imagery or symbolism and share what each one teaches them about Jesus Christ. For example, what do we learn from these symbols about how Christ leads His Church today? How does John's description of the Savior compare to the one in Doctrine and Covenants 110:1–4?</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 2–3; 7:13–17</heading>
<heading>We can overcome challenges through Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>We're like the Saints John wrote to in at least one way: we face adversity. Invite class members to search Revelation 2–3 and identify the trials the Saints in John's time were facing, and help them understand that Jesus Christ knew each branch's trials and strengths. Maybe they could share experiences in which they felt that the Savior was aware of their unique circumstances. What counsel did the Lord give the Saints that can also help us overcome our struggles?</li>
<li>In these same chapters the Lord made inspiring promises to those who overcome. You could invite class members to work in pairs to search Revelation 2–3; 7:13–17 to find the Lord's promises. Perhaps they could also draw pictures to represent some of these promises, then share with the class what they find. How do these promises inspire them to continue striving to overcome their own trials and weaknesses?</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 5</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ was the only one who could make Heavenly Father's plan possible.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Would an object lesson help your class understand the symbolism in Revelation 5 about the Savior opening the sealed book? You might bring a treat in a locked container to share with the class. Before class, secretly give one person the key to the lock. Describe to the class what is inside the container, and allow several class members to try opening the box before the person with the key opens it. Then the class could compare this object lesson to Revelation 5. Questions like these might help: How is the salvation of Heavenly Father's children like the locked container or the sealed book? Why was Jesus Christ the only one who could open the seals? (see the quotation in "Additional Resources"). What blessings were dependent on the Savior's worthiness to open the seals? (see Revelation 7:14–17).</li>
<li>Like the jubilant people mentioned in Revelation 5, today we can also raise our voices to praise the Savior as the one who is worthy to offer us salvation. Perhaps class members could sing together some favorite hymns of praise about the Savior. For instance, you might sing "Glory to God on High" (Hymns, no. 67; or see the video "Worthy Is the Lamb" on LDS.org) and identify truths this hymn teaches about Jesus Christ. What experiences have helped us gain testimonies of these truths? What similarities do we see between the messages of our hymns of praise and the declarations in Revelation 5:9–14? How can we better use hymns at home and at church to worship and praise the Lord?</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 7</heading>
<heading>Before the Second Coming, the Lord will gather the righteous and prepare them to dwell with Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Revelation 7 describes events of the "sixth seal," some of which represent our day. It also answers the question at the end of chapter 6: "The great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?" (verse 17). Perhaps class members could look for answers to this question in chapter 7. Here are some other questions they could discuss: Why did the Lord delay the destruction of the earth for a time? How do ordinances and covenants "seal [us] up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be poured out"? (D&amp;C 1:9). What is our work in preparing the world for the Second Coming? Doctrine and Covenants 1:4–23; 77:8–11 might provide additional insights.</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 1–11</heading>
<heading>John's vision teaches how Heavenly Father saves His children.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some class members may find the book of Revelation difficult to understand. It may be helpful if they consider John's writings in the context of Heavenly Father's plan to exalt His children. As class members read Revelation 1–11 at home, they may have found truths that helped them understand Heavenly Father's plan for His children (see this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families). Invite them to share what they found. They may also find it helpful to review the section in "Additional Resources" titled "Scriptures about the plan of salvation." Encourage class members to continue looking for scriptures that teach truths about the plan of salvation as they read the rest of Revelation, and give them an opportunity during future lessons to share what they find.</li>
</ul>

<p>Describing events in the premortal life, Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"Christ volunteered to honor the moral agency of all humankind even as He atoned for their sins. In the process, He would return to the Father all glory for such redemptive love.
"This infinite Atonement of Christ was possible because (1) He was the only sinless man ever to live on this earth and therefore was not subject to the spiritual death resulting from sin, (2) He was the Only Begotten of the Father and therefore possessed the attributes of godhood that gave Him power over physical death, and (3) He was apparently the only one sufficiently humble and willing in the premortal council to be foreordained to that service" ("The Atonement of Jesus Christ," Ensign or Liahona, Mar. 2008, 35).</p>

The scriptures and words of latter-day prophets and apostles are the source of the truths we teach" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 21).</p>

<heading>"Good Tidings of Great Joy"</heading>
<p>Gospel discussions are spiritually powerful when they are centered on Jesus Christ. As you study the birth and mission of Jesus Christ this week, seek inspiration from the Holy Ghost to know how you can best center your class discussion on the Savior.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Invite class members to share what they are doing or have done in the past as individuals or families to celebrate the Savior's birth in ways that bring them closer to Him.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MATTHEW 1:18–25; LUKE 1:26–38; 2:1–20</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ condescended to be born on earth.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To condescend means to voluntarily descend from a position of rank or dignity (see 1 Nephi 11:14–26). Christmas is a good time to ponder and celebrate the condescension of Christ — His willingness to leave "his Father's courts on high, with man to live, for man to die" ("Again We Meet around the Board," Hymns, no. 186). To inspire a discussion on this topic, you could ask class members what they learned in their personal or family study this week about who Jesus Christ was before He was born (see John 17:5; Mosiah 7:27; D&amp;C 76:12–14, 20–24; Moses 4:2). Then you could display the image in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families as class members read about the Savior's birth (see Matthew 1:18–25; Luke 1:26–38; 2:1–20). What thoughts and feelings do they have as they compare the Savior's premortal glory with His humble birth?</li>
<li>A question like the one the angel asked Nephi in 1 Nephi 11:16 could be a good way to start a class discussion, though you might word it differently. Maybe you could write on the board<i>What is the condescension of God?</i>and ask class members to ponder this question as they read 1 Nephi 11:17–33. Ask them to share any thoughts about the Savior that these verses inspire. What pictures could you show the class that depict scenes from the Savior's life described by Nephi? They could also consider the condescension of the Savior as they watch a video about His birth, such as "A Gift to the World," "The Nativity," "Infant Holy, Infant Lowly (Music Video) — Mormon Tabernacle Choir," or "He Is the Gift" (all of these can be found on LDS.org).</li>
<li>Music is a wonderful way to invite the Spirit to your class. Consider playing Christmas hymns performed by the Tabernacle Choir (see mormontabernaclechoir.org), inviting someone to perform a Christmas song, or reading or singing a few hymns together as a class (see Hymns, nos. 201–14). Class members could look for phrases in these hymns and the scriptures listed with the hymns that increase their gratitude for the Savior and His willingness to come to earth.</li>
</ul>
<heading>LUKE 4:16–21; JOHN 3:16</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ fulfilled His mission, which made it possible for us to inherit eternal life.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members discuss the reasons Jesus Christ was born, you could invite them to find and share scriptures that summarize His mission (see this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families for some examples). Perhaps class members could look for and read verses in pairs or small groups. What do they learn about Christ's mission from the verses they found? What do we learn about His mission from some of the titles He is given in the scriptures? (see Bible Dictionary, "Christ, names of").</li>
<li>Class members could learn about the Savior's mission by reading "The Living Christ: The Testimony of the Apostles" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, inside front cover) and sharing statements they find that explain why He came to earth. Or they could review the message by President Gordon B. Hinckley in "Additional Resources" and discuss what they learn about the Savior. How can we make time this Christmas season for "silent meditation and quiet reflection" on the Savior and His mission?</li>
<li>Give class members time to reflect on their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His mission. Could they share personal experiences or stories from the Savior's life that have increased their faith in or love for Him? How has studying the New Testament this year contributed to a more meaningful Christmas season? To review some of the New Testament accounts class members have learned about this year, you might show the videos "For God So Loved the World" or "To This End Was I Born" (LDS.org).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Suggest to your class members that studying Revelation 12–22 this week can deepen their appreciation for the Savior's role in the plan of salvation and add meaning to their observance of Christmas.</p>

<heading>The true essence of Christmas.</heading>
<graphics-caption note="image placed in middle of Hinckley quote">Gethsemane, by J. Kirk Richards</graphics-caption>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley taught:
"When all is said and done, . . . nothing is so wonderful, so majestic, so tremendous as this act of grace when the Son of the Almighty, . . . He who had condescended to come to earth as a babe born in Bethlehem, gave His life in ignominy and pain so that all of the sons and daughters of God of all generations of time, every one of whom must die, might walk again and live eternally. He did for us what none of us could do for ourselves. . . .
"This is the wondrous and true story of Christmas. The birth of Jesus in Bethlehem of Judea is preface. The three-year ministry of the Master is prologue. The magnificent substance of the story is His sacrifice, the totally selfless act of dying in pain on the cross of Calvary to atone for the sins of all of us.
"The epilogue is the miracle of the Resurrection, bringing the assurance that «as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive» [1 Cor. 15:22].
"There would be no Christmas if there had not been Easter. The babe Jesus of Bethlehem would be but another baby without the redeeming Christ of Gethsemane and Calvary, and the triumphant fact of the Resurrection.
"I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Eternal, Living God. None so great has ever walked the earth. None other has made a comparable sacrifice or granted a comparable blessing. He is the Savior and the Redeemer of the world. I believe in Him. I declare His divinity without equivocation or compromise. I love Him. I speak His name in reverence and wonder. . . .
"For each of you may this be a merry Christmas. But more importantly, I wish for each of you a time, perhaps only an hour, spent in silent meditation and quiet reflection on the wonder and the majesty of this, the Son of God. Our joy at this season is because He came into the world. The peace that comes from Him, His infinite love which each of us may feel, and an overwhelming sense of gratitude for that which He freely gave us at so great a cost to Himself — these are of the true essence of Christmas" ("The Wondrous and True Story of Christmas," Ensign, Dec. 2000, 4–5).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Reserve time for learners to share.</b>"When learners share what they are learning, they not only feel the Spirit and strengthen their own testimonies, but they also encourage other class members to discover truths for themselves. . . . Reserve time for student sharing in every lesson — in some cases, you may find that these discussions are the lesson" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 30).</p>

<heading>Revelation 12–22</heading>
<heading>"He That Overcometh Shall Inherit All Things"</heading>
<p>What does the battle between good and evil described in Revelation teach you about the importance of following Christ here on earth? After pondering this principle, consider the needs of your class members. What truths from Revelation can help them make righteous choices?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>As your class members come to the end of their New Testament study, encourage them to share their thoughts about the New Testament. How has their scripture study strengthened their testimonies?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>REVELATION 12:7–11</heading>
<heading>We overcame Satan "by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of [our] testimony."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Learning about the War in Heaven can help us better understand life on earth. Class members could read Joseph Smith Translation, Revelation 12:7–11 (in the Bible appendix) and identify how we overcame Satan and his hosts in the War in Heaven. What other insights do we gain from the entries on the War in Heaven in the Bible Dictionary or Gospel Topics? (topics.lds.org). What do we learn that can help us overcome the adversary during our mortal lives?</li>
<li>What does it mean that the Lamb was "slain from the foundation of the world"? (Revelation 13:8; see also Revelation 5:6). Consider helping your class members find answers to this question by reading Mosiah 3:13 and Moses 7:47 as a class. What does it mean to overcome Satan "by the blood of the Lamb"? (Revelation 12:11).</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 17–18</heading>
<heading>We must separate ourselves from the wickedness of the world.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It's not particularly pleasant to read about the wickedness of Babylon and its fall in Revelation 17–18, but it is instructive because Babylon can be a symbol of the wicked world we live in today. Maybe you could divide these chapters among small groups of class members and ask them to look for answers to questions like these: Why are people drawn to Babylon, or worldliness? Why is Babylon dangerous? What will happen to Babylon? What warnings did John give to help us avoid Babylon's fate?</li>
<li>After reading Revelation 18:4, class members may want to discuss how they can "come out of" Babylon and "be not partakers of her sins." For example, what scriptures or messages from Church leaders have helped us resist the temptations of Babylon, or the world? Consider watching the video "Dare to Stand Alone" or "Separating Ourselves from the World" (LDS.org) or reading Elder Quentin L. Cook's statement in "Additional Resources." What ideas can class members share about how to apply the two principles Elder Cook mentioned? In what sense do we "come out" of Babylon? (see, for instance, D&amp;C 133:12–14). What can we do to encourage others to do the same?</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 19:5–20:15</heading>
<heading>We can prepare for the Lord's Second Coming and the Day of Judgment.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Second Coming of Jesus Christ is frequently called "the great and the terrible day of the Lord" (Joel 2:31), and based on Revelation 19–20, that seems like a good description. Consider writing on the board some of the events described in Revelation 19:5–20:15. Invite class members to find the verses that describe these events. Why are these events called great and terrible? What do we learn from these verses about the Savior and those who follow Him? What can we do now to be among those who will rejoice at the time of His coming?</li>
<li>To inspire a discussion about the book of life, you could invite class members to create a simple book by folding a piece of paper into fourths. They could then read Revelation 20:12–15, ponder what they want written about them in the book of life, and write those things in their books. (Definitions for the "book of life" can be found in "Additional Resources.") How would we feel if we were called before the throne of God today? Consider using Elder Jörg Klebingat's message "Approaching the Throne of God with Confidence" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 34–37) as part of the discussion. You could also review Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's message "Be Ye Therefore Perfect — Eventually" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 40–42). What do these messages contribute to this discussion about preparing for the Day of Judgment?</li>
</ul>
<heading>REVELATION 21:1–22:5</heading>
<heading>If we are faithful, we will be blessed with celestial glory.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Though the latter days are prophesied to be filled with wickedness and peril, the reward John saw for the faithful far exceeds the tribulation that precedes it. To help class members explore this beautiful conclusion to Revelation, you could invite them to review Revelation 21:1–22:5, looking for phrases that inspire them to strive for celestial glory. What promises are made to the faithful? How does this description help us when we face our current challenges and trials?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to study the Book of Mormon next year — individually and with their families — share some of these prophetic promises.</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley: "Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will [read the Book of Mormon], regardless of how many times you previously may have read [it], there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God" ("A Testimony Vibrant and True," Ensign, Aug. 2005, 6).</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson: "I implore each of us to prayerfully study and ponder the Book of Mormon each day. As we do so, we will be in a position to hear the voice of the Spirit, to resist temptation, to overcome doubt and fear, and to receive heaven's help in our lives" ("The Power of the Book of Mormon," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 87).</p>

<heading>Choosing righteousness over Babylon's wickedness.</heading>
<p>Elder Quentin L. Cook taught:
"We cannot avoid the world. A cloistered existence is not the answer. In a positive sense, our contribution to the world is part of our challenge and is essential if we are to develop our talents. . . . Members of the Church need to be involved in the world in a positive way. How then do we balance the need to positively contribute to the world and to not succumb to the sins of the world? (See D&amp;C 25:10; D&amp;C 59:9.) Two principles will make a significant difference.
"1. Let people know you are a committed Latter-day Saint. . . .
"2. Be confident about and live your beliefs" ("Lessons from the Old Testament: In the World but Not of the World," Ensign, Feb. 2006, 54–55).</p>
<heading>The book of life.</heading>
<p>Philippians 4:3; Revelation 3:5; 17:8; 2 Nephi 29:11; Alma 5:58; Doctrine and Covenants 127:6–7, 9;</p>
<p>"In one sense the book of life is the sum total of one's not the answer. In a positive sense, our contribution to the world is part of our challenge and is essential if we are to develop our talents. . . . Members of the Church need to be involved in the world in a positive way. How then do we balance the need to positively contribute thoughts and actions — the record of his [or her] life. However, the scriptures indicate that a heavenly record is kept of the faithful, whose names are recorded, as well as an account of their righteous deeds" (Bible Dictionary, "Book of life").</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>It's OK to say "I don't know."</b>"While it is natural to want to answer every question, in some situations it is appropriate to simply say, «I don't know. Let's study that question on our own this week, and we can discuss it next time»" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 24). Then ask class members to search the scriptures and other Church resources for answers.</p>
