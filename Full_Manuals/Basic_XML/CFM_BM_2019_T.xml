<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading>You Are a Teacher in the Church of Jesus Christ</heading>
<p>You have been called of God to teach His children in the Savior's way. You were set apart to this calling by the authority of His holy priesthood. Even if you are not an experienced teacher, as you live worthily, pray daily, and study the scriptures, Heavenly Father will grant you the influence and power of the Holy Ghost to help you succeed (see 2 Nephi 33:1).
Those entrusted to your care are Heavenly Father's children, and He knows what they need and how best to reach them. Through the Holy Ghost, God will guide you as you prepare and while you are teaching. He will reveal to you what you should say and what you should do (see 2 Nephi 32:5).
The essential purpose of gospel teaching and learning is to change lives. Your goal as a teacher is to help those you teach do all they can to become more converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ — an effort that extends far beyond class time. Invite those you teach to actively participate in learning the principles and doctrine of Jesus Christ and to act on what they learn. Encourage them to make their individual and family study outside of class the primary source of their gospel learning. As they act in faith by studying as individuals and families, they will invite the Spirit into their lives, and it is the Spirit that brings about true conversion. Everything you do as a teacher should point to this sacred objective.
Teach only the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as found in the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets. Pure doctrine — eternal, unchanging truth taught by God and His servants — invites the Spirit and has the power to change lives.
The calling to teach is a sacred trust, and it is normal to feel overwhelmed at times. But remember that your Heavenly Father called you, and He will never forsake you. This is the Lord's work, and as you serve "with all your heart, might, mind and strength" (D&amp;C 4:2), He will enlarge your capacities, gifts, and talents, and your service will bless the lives of those you teach.</p>

<heading>Using Come, Follow Me—For Sunday School</heading>
<heading>Preparing to Teach in Sunday School</heading>
<p>Personal and family study at home should be the center of gospel learning. This is true for you and for those you teach. As you prepare to teach, start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.
Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families is an important part of both your personal study and your preparation to teach. It will help you gain a deeper understanding of the doctrinal principles found in the scriptures. It will also enable you to inspire and invite class members to use Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families to enhance their personal and family scripture study (for help doing this, see "Ideas for Encouraging Personal and Family Study" in this resource). As you do, remember to be sensitive to class members whose family circumstances may not support regular family scripture study and family home evening.
During your preparation, thoughts and impressions will come to you about the people you teach, how the principles in the scriptures will bless their lives, and how you can inspire them to discover those principles as they study the scriptures for themselves.</p>
<heading>Teaching Ideas</heading>
<p>As you prepare to teach, you might gain additional inspiration by exploring the teaching outlines in this resource. Don't think of these ideas as step-by-step instructions but rather as suggestions to spark your own inspiration. You know your class members, and you will get to know them even better as you learn together in class. The Lord knows them too, and He will inspire you with the best ways to help class members build on the gospel learning they are doing at home.
Many other resources are available for you to use as you prepare, including ideas in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families and Church magazines. For more information about these and other resources, see the section titled "Additional Resources" in this resource.</p>
<heading>Some Things to Keep in Mind</heading>
<ul>
<li>The home is the best environment for gospel learning. As a teacher, you have an important responsibility to support, encourage, and build upon class members' gospel learning at home.</li>
<li>Class members' conversion to the gospel of Jesus Christ will deepen as they understand and apply true doctrine. Encourage them to record and act on the impressions they receive from the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li>Teaching is more than lecturing, but it is also more than simply leading a discussion. Part of your role is to encourage participation that edifies and is based on the scriptures. You should also share the inspired insights you received as you studied the scriptures.</li>
<li>Heavenly Father wants you to succeed as a teacher. He has provided many resources to help you, including teacher council meetings. In these meetings you can counsel with other teachers about challenges you face. You can also discuss and practice principles of Christlike teaching.</li>
<li>People learn best when they have opportunities to teach. On occasion, consider allowing class members, including youth, to teach a part of the lesson. Base this decision on the needs and abilities of class members. If you do invite a class member to teach, take the time to help him or her prepare in advance by using the ideas found in this resource and in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. Remember that as the called teacher, you are ultimately responsible for what is taught in class.</li>
<li>This resource includes teaching outlines for every week of the year except for the two Sundays when general conference is held. On Sundays when Sunday School is not held because of stake conference or for any other reason, families may continue reading the Book of Mormon at home according to the schedule outlined in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. In order to keep your Sunday School class on schedule, you may choose to either skip a lesson or combine two lessons. To avoid confusion, Sunday School presidents may wish to advise Sunday School teachers about these adjustments ahead of time.</li>
</ul>

<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading>Ideas for Encouraging Personal and Family Study</heading>
<p>Here are some ideas to help you encourage class members to study the word of God at home, both individually and as families. Be sensitive to the fact that not all class members can study the scriptures with their families (for example, some members live alone or in part-member families).</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite class members to share experiences they had studying the scriptures at home. For example, you could ask them to share a verse that impressed them and to explain why they found it meaningful.</li>
<li>Ask class members to give examples of what they are doing to make personal or family scripture study more meaningful. (Some ideas can be found under "Ideas to Improve Your Personal Scripture Study" and "Ideas to Improve Your Family Scripture Study" in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.)</li>
<li>Invite class members to share how they acted on impressions they received during their personal or family scripture study.</li>
<li>Spend a few minutes showing class members some of the resources provided by the Church to help members study the gospel, such as the scripture study helps found at scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; "Scripture Stories" found at children.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; youth-focused content at youth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; seminary and institute manuals; and videos, audio recordings, and images found at medialibrary.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Many of these are also in the Gospel Library app.</li>
<li>Spend a few minutes explaining how to use the Gospel Library app to study the scriptures, including how to mark verses and record impressions.</li>
<li>Invite one or more class members to share how they have taught a specific gospel principle in their families.</li>
</ul>

</chapter>
<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading>A Pattern for Teaching</heading>
<p>In this resource, you will find the following three-step pattern repeated in each outline: invite sharing, teach the doctrine, and encourage learning at home. As you teach, the elements of this pattern may overlap or occur in a different order. For example, consider that sharing is an opportunity to teach the doctrine, and teaching doctrine should involve invitations to share. Likewise, encouraging learning at home can happen throughout a class discussion. Allow adjustments in this pattern to happen naturally, following the promptings of the Spirit to meet the needs of the people you teach.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>As part of every class, invite class members to share insights and experiences they had during the previous week as they studied the scriptures as individuals and families and applied what they learned. Help class members see that their personal learning outside of class is important. Their individual conversion will come not only through Sunday learning but also through their daily experiences. When class members hear each other's experiences, they are more likely to seek similar experiences of their own. Not everyone will have read the chapters for each lesson, and even some who did may not feel comfortable sharing. Make sure all class members feel they are a valued part of the class, whether or not they have something to share.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<p>You and your class members should focus on doctrine — the eternal truths of the gospel–found in the assigned scripture passages. As you discuss doctrine from the scriptures, what verses, quotations, experiences, questions, and additional resources might you share? How might you use these resources to help class members discover and understand gospel principles? How can you encourage class members to record and act upon the thoughts and impressions they receive?</p>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>At the end of the lesson, take a moment to preview next week's discussion. Consider how to inspire class members to continue learning from the Book of Mormon at home, both individually and with their families.</p>

<heading type="date">DECEMBER 30–JANUARY 5</heading>
<heading type="ref">Introductory Pages of the Book of Mormon</heading>
<heading type="title">"ANOTHER TESTAMENT OF JESUS CHRIST"</heading>
<p>Study the Book of Mormon's title page and introduction; the testimonies of the Three Witnesses, the Eight Witnesses, and the Prophet Joseph Smith; and "A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon." As you do, seek promptings from the Holy Ghost about how you can inspire your class to begin a meaningful study of the Book of Mormon.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To begin, you could invite a few people to share something they learned from the introductory pages of the Book of Mormon that increased their testimony of this sacred book.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>TITLE PAGE OF THE BOOK OF MORMON</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon can strengthen our faith in Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Reading the Book of Mormon's title page, written by Moroni, can prepare members of your class to study the Book of Mormon this year. How might the messages on the title page enhance their study? Maybe you could write one or more questions on the board — such as Why do we have the Book of Mormon? or How is the Book of Mormon different from other books? — and invite class members to look for answers as they review the title page individually or in pairs. They could then share impressions that came to them. You might also encourage class members to discuss their plans for studying the Book of Mormon this year. For example, what will they be looking for? How will they learn from the Holy Ghost as they study?</li>
<li>One of the most important purposes of the Book of Mormon is stated on its title page: to convince "Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ." You might invite class members to share passages from the Book of Mormon that have strengthened their faith in Jesus Christ (they could also read a few passages listed in "Additional Resources"). Class members could read some of these verses with someone sitting nearby and share how the Book of Mormon has influenced their testimony of the Savior.</li>
</ul>
<heading>INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK OF MORMON</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon can help us "get nearer to God."</heading>
<ul>
<li>The introduction to the Book of Mormon provides information that is important for readers to understand. Your class members might benefit from scanning the introduction and identifying three to five points that would be helpful to share with someone reading the Book of Mormon for the first time. Class members could then share what they find. They may even want to role-play introducing the Book of Mormon to someone. The videos suggested in "Additional Resources" might also help.</li>
<li note="this is all one paragraph in the manual, but I'm breaking it up so I can treat quotes separately"><p>Some members of your class may have had experiences that confirmed the truth of Joseph Smith's words: "A man would get nearer to God by abiding by [the Book of Mormon's] precepts, than by any other book." You might ask class members to share how living the truths they've learned in the Book of Mormon has helped them get nearer to God.</p><p> You could also invite class members to share answers to these three questions suggested by President Russell M. Nelson: "First, what would your life be like without the Book of Mormon? Second, what would you not know? And third, what would you not have?" ("The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 61).</p></li>
<li>Did anyone in your class read Book of Mormon passages that contain different names for the plan of salvation, as suggested in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families? If so, invite them to share what they learned.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Three Witnesses bore testimony of the Book of Mormon.</graphics-caption>
<heading>"THE TESTIMONY OF THREE WITNESSES"; "THE TESTIMONY OF EIGHT WITNESSES"</heading>
<heading>We can all be witnesses of the Book of Mormon.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying the testimonies of the Three and the Eight Witnesses could strengthen your class members' testimonies and help them ponder how they might share their own witnesses. You could ask half of the class to read "The Testimony of Three Witnesses" and the other half to read "The Testimony of Eight Witnesses" and share impressions or details that stand out to them. How are the two testimonies different? How are they similar? What do we learn from these witnesses about sharing our testimonies? To start a discussion about why the Three Witnesses are important, you could share President Dallin H. Oaks's statement or John Whitmer's testimony in "Additional Resources," or you might show the video "The Testimony of the Three Witnesses" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</li>
</ul>
<heading>"THE TESTIMONY OF THE PROPHET JOSEPH SMITH"</heading>
<heading>Joseph Smith was an instrument in God's hands to bring forth the Book of Mormon.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members may already be familiar with the events described in "The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith," but perhaps you can help them find new insights. For example, you could invite them to list key events in Joseph Smith's account. What can we conclude from his experience about the importance the Lord has placed on the Book of Mormon?</li>
<li>The hymn "An Angel from on High" (Hymns, no. 13) tells of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. After singing or listening to this hymn, class members could find statements in "The Testimony of the Prophet Joseph Smith" that match or reinforce phrases in the song.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read 1 Nephi 1–7, invite them to look for ideas or truths that help them with their current life circumstances — for example, a family challenge or a Church calling.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>

<heading>The importance of the Three Witnesses.</heading>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks explained why the testimony of the Three Witnesses is so compelling:
"The testimony of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon stands forth in great strength. Each of the three had ample reason and opportunity to renounce his testimony if it had been false, or to equivocate on details if any had been inaccurate. As is well known, because of disagreements or jealousies involving other leaders of the Church, each one of these three witnesses was excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by about eight years after the publication of their testimony. All three went their separate ways, with no common interest to support a collusive effort. Yet to the end of their lives — periods ranging from 12 to 50 years after their excommunications — not one of these witnesses deviated from his published testimony or said anything that cast any shadow on its truthfulness" ("The Witness: Martin Harris," Ensign, May 1999, 36).</p>
<heading>The testimony of John Whitmer.</heading>
<p>John Whitmer, one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon, declared: "I have never heard that any one of the three or eight witnesses ever denied the testimony that they have borne. . . . Our names have gone forth to all nations, tongues and people as a divine revelation from God. And it will bring to pass the designs of God according to the declaration therein contained" (in Noel B. Reynolds, ed., Book of Mormon Authorship Revisited: The Evidence for Ancient Origins [1997], 55–56).</p>

<graphics-caption>Lehi Traveling Near the Red Sea, by Gary Smith</graphics-caption>
<heading type="date">JANUARY 6–12</heading>
<heading type="ref">1 Nephi 1–7</heading>
<heading type="title">"I WILL GO AND DO"</heading>
<p>Your preparation as a Sunday School teacher begins with your personal study of the scriptures. Pay attention to and record the spiritual promptings you receive. Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families can supplement your study.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Many of your class members are probably familiar with 1 Nephi 1–7, but each time we read the scriptures, we can learn truths that apply to our current circumstances. To begin your discussion, perhaps you could ask class members what they learned or were reminded of as they studied this week.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>1 NEPHI 1; 3–6</heading>
<heading>The scriptures are of great worth.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One prominent message in the Book of Mormon is the great value of the word of God. This could be a good message to share as your class begins studying the Book of Mormon. You could begin by asking each class member to select a chapter from 1 Nephi 1; 3–6 and scan it, looking for ways the word of God direct or indirectly blessed Lehi's family members. (Class members may benefit from doing this activity in small groups.) Then invite individuals to share what they find. What do these accounts teach us about the importance of the scriptures?</li>
<li>One of your goals as a teacher is to encourage individuals and families to study the gospel outside of class. Perhaps you could invite class members to examine how Lehi studied the plates of brass (see 1 Nephi 5:10–19), and then you could ask questions like the following: What was Lehi's attitude toward the scriptures? What did he find of value in them? Class members could also explore Elder Richard G. Scott's message "The Power of Scripture" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 6–8) or read an excerpt from this message in "Additional Resources." How can we apply Elder Scott's teachings as we study the Book of Mormon this year?</li>
<li><p>As a class, you could sing a hymn about the scriptures, such as "As I Search the Holy Scriptures" (Hymns, no. 277). You could then invite class members to share how their personal scripture study has blessed their lives.</p>
<p>They could also share how the scriptures have inspired them to "come unto. . . God. . . and be saved" (1 Nephi 6:4).</p></li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 2:11–19; 3:28–31</heading>
<heading>We can gain our own testimonies as we soften our hearts.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Nephi is known for his powerful faith in the Lord, but it may be helpful for class members to realize that he had to work to gain his testimony — just as we all do. Perhaps class members could identify in 1 Nephi 2:16–19 what made it possible for Nephi to gain his witness. They could also review verses 11–14 to observe why Laman and Lemuel didn't gain a witness. This might be a good time to invite class members to share how they gained their testimonies.</li>
<li>Sometimes we might want to have a miraculous experience in order to gain or strengthen our testimonies. But Laman and Lemuel encountered an angel, and yet their faith seemed minimally affected. What can class members learn from this experience, described in 1 Nephi 3:28–31, about what strengthens our own testimonies? (see also 1 Nephi 2:16). Consider sharing the quotation by President Harold B. Lee in "Additional Resources." What can we do to keep our testimonies strong?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 3–4</heading>
<heading>God will prepare a way for us to do His will.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The experience of Lehi's sons in 1 Nephi 3–4 may seem exceptional, but many of us have had experiences where we followed God's will even though it seemed difficult. As class members read 1 Nephi 3–4 this week, what truths did they find that reminded them of a personal experience? Maybe you could ask class members to share verses that taught these truths, and invite them to share their experiences. How do these truths help us when we are expected by God to do something that seems difficult?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Their Joy Was Full, by Walter Ran</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>You could divide the class into three groups and assign each group to study one of the attempts to get the brass plates from Laban (see 1 Nephi 3:9–21; 1 Nephi 3:22–31; 4:1–4; and 1 Nephi 4:5–38). Then you could invite each group to share what each of these attempts teaches us about accomplishing the Lord's will. How do these examples apply to our own efforts to do God's will?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read 1 Nephi 8–10, you might share this statement from President Dieter F. Uchtdorf: "With so many forces trying to draw us away, how do we keep our vision fixed on the glorious happiness promised to the faithful? I believe the answer can be found in a dream that a prophet had thousands of years ago. The prophet's name is Lehi, and his dream is recorded in the precious and wonderful Book of Mormon" ("Three Sisters," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 18–19).</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Book of Mormon videos.</heading>
<p>Find videos that depict accounts from 1 Nephi 1–7 in the Book of Mormon Videos collection on ChurchofJesusChrist.org or the Gospel Library app.</p>
<heading>The scriptures have potent power.</heading>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott testified of the value of the scriptures:
"Scriptures are like packets of light that illuminate our minds and give place to guidance and inspiration from on high. They can become the key to open the channel to communion with our Father in Heaven and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.
"The scriptures. . . can become stalwart friends th are not limited by geography or calendar. They are always available when needed. Their use provides a foundation of truth that can be awakened by the Holy Ghost. Learning, pondering, searching, and memorizing scriptures is like filling a filing cabinet with friends, values, and truths that can be called upon anytime, anywhere in the world. . . . 
"Pondering a passage of scripture can be a key to unlock revelation and the guidance and inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Scriptures can calm an agitated soul, giving peace, hope, and a restoration of confidence in one's ability to overcome the challenges of life. They have potent power to heal emotional challenges when there is faith in the Savior. They can accelerate physical healing" ("The Power of Scripture," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 6).</p>
<heading>Our testimonies must be renewed daily.</heading>
<p>President Harold B. Lee taught, "That which you possess today in testimony will not be yours tomorrow unless you do something about it" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B. Lee [2000], 43).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Use stories and examples to teach gospel principles.</b>Many of the eternal truths in the scriptures are taught through the experiences or stories they contain. As you prepare to teach, think of experiences you have had that could add a second witness to the accounts in the scriptures and the principles they illustrate. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 22.)</p>

<graphics-caption>Lehi's Dream, by Steven Lloyd Neal</graphics-caption>
<heading type="date">JANUARY 13–19</heading>
<heading type="ref">1 Nephi 8–10</heading>
<heading type="title">"COME AND PARTAKE OF THE FRUIT"</heading>
<p>Before reading the ideas in this outline, read 1 Nephi 8–10 and think about the challenges and opportunities facing the people you teach. Record your impressions about which principles from these chapters you should focus on in class.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Lehi's vision has many applications for our day. At the beginning of class, you might want to invite class members to share their insights as they read about this vision. Encourage them to share specific verses and the meaning they found for their lives.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>1 NEPHI 8:10–16</heading>
<heading>When we experience God's love, we desire to help others experience it.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It's natural to share things we love with people we love, but sometimes we find it hard to share the gospel. A discussion about Lehi's vision may help class members find opportunities to share the gospel. You might give a class member a piece of fruit and ask him or her to persuade the rest of the class to eat this fruit regularly. How is this object lesson similar to Lehi's experience in 1 Nephi 8:10–16? What do we learn from Lehi's experience that will help us as we share the gospel? As part of this discussion, you may want to share the video "Good Things to Share" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</li>
<li>Elder David A. Bednar taught, "The fruit on the tree is a symbol for the blessings of the Atonement" ("Lehi's Dream: Holding Fast to the Rod," Ensign or Liahona, Oct. 2011, 34). Consider contacting a few class members in advance and asking them to reflect on 1 Nephi 8:11–16 and think about questions like these: How would I describe the sweetness that the Atonement of Jesus Christ has brought into my life? How have I beckoned to others to taste its sweetness? (see verse 15). How have others invited me to seek the blessings of the Savior's Atonement? What am I inspired to do as I read 1 Nephi 8:11–16? Invite these members to share their answers during class, and invite all class members to offer their insights during the discussion.</li>

<li>One way to begin a discussion about Lehi's vision is to invite a few class members to draw a representation of the vision on the board, using 1 Nephi 8:19–38 as a guide. Or you could show the picture of Lehi's vision from this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. You could then invite each class member to find verses that give an interpretation of one of the symbols in the drawing or picture — these interpretations can be found in 1 Nephi 11:4–25, 35–36; 12:16–18; and 15:21–33, 36. As class members share what they found, invite them to discuss what these symbols teach us. For example, what does a great and spacious building teach us about pride? What does a rod of iron teach us about the word of God? They could also talk about how Lehi's vision has helped them come unto Christ. How have we seen ourselves in the vision?</li>
<li>One prominent message in Lehi's vision is the importance of the word of God, symbolized by the iron rod. To help emphasize that message, you could divide the class into four groups and assign each to learn about the four groups of people that Lehi saw, as described in "Additional Resources" and in 1 Nephi 8:21–23, 24–28, 30, and 31–33. Then let class members share with each other what they learned. You might also provide a few minutes for class members to ponder what they feel impressed to do to ensure that they are "holding fast to the rod of iron" (1 Nephi 8:30).</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 10:17–19</heading>
<heading>God will reveal truth to us if we diligently seek it.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Mists of darkness that obscure our path and mocking voices from the great and spacious building can make it hard for us to find the truth. Reading together about Nephi's example as a seeker of truth could help. You might begin the discussion by asking class members to identify some of the confusing messages the world is sending. For instance, what worldly ideas did prophets and apostles warn us about in the most recent general conference? Consider making a list on the board of the steps that Nephi took to gain his own witness of the truth of his father's vision (see 1 Nephi 10:17–19; 11:1). How can we follow his example as we seek truth?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read 1 Nephi 11–15, invite them to find out what the following images have to do with Lehi's dream: the infant Jesus, a cross, the mother of harlots, multitudes gathered together to battle, and books.</p>

<heading>Four groups of people in Lehi's dream.</heading>
<p>Group 1: "In 1 Nephi 8:21–23 we learn about the first group of people who pressed forward and commenced in the path that led to the tree of life. However, as the people encountered the mist of darkness, which represents «the temptations of the devil» (1 Nephi 12:17), they lost their way, wandered off, and were lost. Notice that no mention is made in these verses of the rod of iron. Those who ignore or treat lightly the word of God do not have access to that divine compass which points the way to the Savior."
Group 2: "In 1 Nephi 8:24–28 we read about a second group of people who obtained the strait and narrow path that led to the tree of life. This group «did press forward through the mist of darkness, clinging to the rod of iron, even until they did come forth and partake of the fruit of the tree» (verse 24). However, as the finely dressed occupants of the great and spacious building mocked this second group of people, «they were ashamed» and «fell away into forbidden paths and were lost» (verse 28). . . . Even with faith, commitment, and the word of God, this group eventually was lost — perhaps because they only periodically read or studied or searched the scriptures."
Group 3: "In verse 30 we read about a third group of people who pressed forward «continually holding fast to the rod of iron, until they came forth and fell down and partook of the fruit of the tree.» The key phrase in this verse is continually holding fast to the rod of iron. The third group also pressed forward with faith and conviction; however, there is no indication that they wandered off, fell into forbidden paths, or were lost. Perhaps this third group of people consistently read and studied and searched the scriptures. . . . This is the group you and I should strive to join."
Group 4: "A fourth group did not seek after the tree, desiring instead the great and spacious building as their ultimate destination (see 1 Nephi 8:31–33)." (David A. Bednar, "Lehi's Dream: Holding Fast to the Rod," Ensign or Liahona, Oct. 2011, 34–36.)</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Express confidence through high expectations.</b>Some learners are not confident in their ability to study the gospel on their own. Promise class members that as they strive to learn on their own, the Holy Ghost will teach them. You might suggest ways to help them get started. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 29–30.)</p>

<heading type="title">"ARMED WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS AND WITH THE POWER OF GOD"</heading>
<p>Begin your preparation to teach by reading 1 Nephi 11–15. Record your thoughts and impressions about the passages and principles you will encourage class members to discuss. The ideas below can help.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>These chapters contain principles that class members may want to consider as they share the gospel with others. Consider writing questions like the following on the board and inviting class members to share things they found in their reading this week that can help answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the Apostasy and the Restoration?</li>
<li>Why is the Book of Mormon necessary?</li>
<li>How can I know the truths of God for myself?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>1 NEPHI 11:1–5, 13–33</heading>
<heading>God sent Jesus Christ as an expression of His love.</heading>
<ul>
<li>An angel showed Nephi symbols and events from the Savior's life that demonstrate the love of God. You might find it helpful to examine these symbols and events as a class and discuss how they demonstrate God's love for us. Are there any pictures, videos, or other visual aids you could show that depict some of the events in these verses? (see, for example, biblevideos.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). How do the Savior's life and Atonement help you understand God's love for you?</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 12–15</heading>
<heading>God will help us resist Satan's influence.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Members of your class may sometimes feel like the people in Nephi's vision who were wandering in mists of darkness or facing the scorn of those in the large and spacious building. You might ask the class why mists of darkness are a good symbol for temptation (see 1 Nephi 12:17) and why the large and spacious building is a good symbol for the vain imaginations and pride of the world (see 1 Nephi 12:18). Then you could divide chapters 12–15 among class members and invite them to search for verses that teach how God will help us overcome temptation, vanity, and pride (see, for instance, 1 Nephi 13:34–40; 14:14).</li>
<li>How can you help the members of your class better understand the power that comes from the word of God? (see 1 Nephi 15:24). You might invite them to discuss questions like the following: What did Nephi learn about the power of God's word? How does Satan try to undermine the word of God? (see 1 Nephi 13:26–29). What did the Lord and His prophets do to preserve His word? As part of your discussion, you might ask a few class members to share how they study the scriptures and what they do to make the word of God a part of their daily lives.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 13</heading>
<heading>The Lord prepared the way for the Restoration of His Church.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Maybe a time line would help class members understand Nephi's vision of the events of the Restoration. You could invite class members to create one on the board, with events they find described in 1 Nephi 13. Which of these events have already taken place? Which are happening now? Consider sharing the quotation in "Additional Resources" by George Washington, first president of the United States, which shows that he recognized the influence of God in the American Revolution, an event that prepared the way for the Restoration.</li>
<li>How would class members use 1 Nephi 13 to explain to someone of another faith why the Restoration was necessary? (for example, see 1 Nephi 13:26–29, 35–42). What other scriptures could class members use to help others understand why the Restoration was necessary? (for some examples, see Topical Guide, "Restoration of the Gospel"). Class members might benefit from role-playing how they would explain to someone the need for the Restoration and how it has blessed them.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 13:20–41</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon teaches plain and precious truths.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It may be helpful to use 1 Nephi 13:20–41 to begin a discussion about why we need the Book of Mormon. Class members could list some of the "plain and precious things" that were lost from the Bible and restored through the Book of Mormon (for some examples, see verses 26 and 39 or the lists in "Additional Resources"). You might also want to invite class members to share how these restored "plain and precious things" have helped them become closer to God.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Spirit can help us discover "plain and precious things" for ourselves.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Consider showing the video "The Book of Mormon — a Book from God" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org), and invite class members to share what this video teaches about why we need the Book of Mormon. Or you could invite a class member to draw on the board the illustration described in Elder Tad R. Callister's quotation in "Additional Resources." Class members could then share how the Book of Mormon has helped them better understand the gospel of Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read 1 Nephi 16–22 during the coming week, you might mention that it includes an account that can inspire and help them when they are required to do something that seems impossible.</p>

<heading>God's hand in the American Revolution.</heading>
<p>George Washington said: "The man must be bad indeed who can look upon the events of the American Revolution without feeling the warmest gratitude towards the great Author of the Universe whose divine interposition was so frequently manifest in our behalf" (Letter to Samuel Langdon, Sept. 28, 1789, founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05–04–02–0070).</p>
<heading>President Russell M. Nelson's Book of Mormon lists.</heading>
<p>From "The Book of Mormon: What Would Your Life Be Like without It?" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 60–63).
<b>The Book of Mormon refutes notions that:</b>
<ul>
<li>Revelation ended with the Bible.</li>
<li>Infants need to be baptized.</li>
<li>Happiness can be found in wickedness.</li>
<li>Individual goodness is adequate for exaltation (ordinances and covenants are needed).</li>
<li>The Fall of Adam tainted mankind with "original sin."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<b>The Book of Mormon clarifies understanding about:</b>
<li>Our premortal existence.</li>
<li>Death. It is a necessary component of God's great plan of happiness.</li>
<li>Postmortal existence, which begins in paradise.</li>
<li>How the resurrection of the body, reunited with its spirit, becomes an immortal soul.</li>
<li>How our judgment by the Lord will be according to our deeds and the desires of our hearts.</li>
<li>How ordinances are properly performed: for example, baptism, sacrament, conferring the Holy Ghost.</li>
<li>The Atonement of Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The Resurrection.</li>
<li>The important role of angels.</li>
<li>The eternal nature of priesthood.</li>
<li>How human behavior is influenced more by the power of the word than the power of the sword.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<heading>We need the Book of Mormon.</heading>
<p>Elder Tad R. Callister taught:
"The Bible is one witness of Jesus Christ; the Book of Mormon is another. Why is this second witness so crucial? The following illustration may help: How many straight lines can you draw through a single point on a piece of paper? The answer is infinite. For a moment, suppose that single point represents the Bible and that hundreds of those straight lines drawn through that point represent different interpretations of the Bible and that each of those interpretations represents a different church.
"What happens, however, if on that piece of paper there is a second point representing the Book of Mormon? How many straight lines could you draw between these two reference points: the Bible and the Book of Mormon? Only one. Only one interpretation of Christ's doctrines survives the testimony of these two witnesses" ("The Book of Mormon — a Book from God," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 75).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Lead inspired discussions.</b>Everyone has something to contribute to class discussions, but sometimes not everyone gets a chance. Look for ways to increase class members' opportunities to share their testimonies. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 33.)</p>

<p>As you read 1 Nephi 16–22, think about how Nephi's example of facing challenges might be helpful to people in your class.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Nephi saw the value of likening the scriptures to himself and his people (see 1 Nephi 19:23). Consider inviting class members to share principles they learned from the account of Nephi's journey to the promised land that relate to their own lives.</p>

<heading>God uses small means to accomplish great things.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Can you, or someone in your class, think of something small that can be used to bring about something great? (see 1 Nephi 16:29). You might invite class members to discuss what they learn about this principle after reading these scriptures individually or in groups: 1 Nephi 16:25–31; Alma 37:3–8; and Doctrine and Covenants 64:33; 123:12–17. How has God used small means to accomplish great things in our lives?</li>
<li>Your class might benefit from discussing how Heavenly Father directs our paths. To start, you might ask the class to discuss the principles that made the Liahona work (see 1 Nephi 16:10–16, 23–31; 18:10–13, 20–22; see also Alma 37:38–47). How might these principles be considered "small means"? Class members could list on the board things that God has provided to guide us (see "Additional Resources" for ideas). What small actions can we take to receive God's guidance?</li>

<heading>1 NEPHI 16:18–32; 17:7–16; 18:1–4</heading>
<heading>When we keep the commandments, God will help us face challenges.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Members of your class may be facing tasks and challenges that seem impossible. How can you use Nephi's experience with his own seemingly impossible tasks — feeding his family in the wilderness and building a ship — to help them? Perhaps class members could read 1 Nephi 16:18–32; 17:7–16; and 18:1–4, looking for principles that can help them when they face a challenging hardship (for example, 1 Nephi 16:24–26 teaches that prayer and humility allow us to receive inspiration and direction from God). You might start by giving them an example of a principle you found in these verses. As they share what they found, they might also share related personal experiences.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 16:18–32; 17:7–22</heading>
<heading>Faith leads to action.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The experiences of Lehi and his family in the wilderness illustrate the power of faith and the consequences of unbelief. To help class members discover these truths, you could write these questions on the board: How did Nephi act on his faith? How was he blessed as a result? What were the consequences of Laman and Lemuel's unbelief? Invite class members as groups to search for answers to these questions in 1 Nephi 16:18–32 or 17:7–22 and share what they find.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 19:22–24</heading>
<heading>We can liken the scriptures to ourselves.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members learn how to liken the scriptures to themselves, they could read examples of how Nephi did it. For instance, in 1 Nephi 4:1–3 and 17:23–32, 41–45, what principles did Nephi teach by likening the scriptures to his family's situation? The account by Elder Robert D. Hales in "Additional Resources" illustrates how likening the scriptures to ourselves can bless us. Consider inviting class members to identify challenges facing them or their family members and then find scriptural accounts that could give them insights and help for those situations. According to 1 Nephi 19:22–24, how can likening the scriptures to ourselves bless us?</li>
<li>Discussing 1 Nephi 19:22–24 can be a great opportunity for class members to share how they "liken the scriptures" to themselves and their families, as well as blessings they have received from doing so. Consider listing on the board class members' ideas about how to liken the scriptures to themselves (for some suggestions, see the list in "Additional Resources"). In a future class, you could invite class members to share experiences when they used the ideas on the list.</li>
</ul>
<heading>1 NEPHI 20–21</heading>
<heading>The Lord will gather the house of Israel in the last days.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To encourage class members to share meaningful teachings they found in 1 Nephi 20–21, consider writing headings like these on the board: Children of Israel, Lehi's Family, and People in Our Day. Give them time to review 1 Nephi 20–21 and list under each heading how Isaiah's prophecies apply to these groups.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read 2 Nephi 1–5, invite them to think about what they would say to their families if their time on earth was short. Point out that the first few chapters of 2 Nephi contain the final message Lehi gave to his family.</p>

<heading>Our "Liahonas."</heading>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar taught: "The Holy Ghost operates in our lives precisely as the Liahona did for Lehi and his family, according to our faith and diligence and heed" ("That We May Always Have His Spirit to Be with Us," Ensign or Liahona, May 2006, 31).</p>
<p> In the October 2005 general conference, Elder Lowell M. Snow of the Seventy said: "This very general conference is a modern Liahona, a time and place to receive inspired guidance and direction that prospers us" ("Compass of the Lord," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2005, 97).</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson taught: "The same Lord who provided a Liahona for Lehi provides for you and for me today a rare and valuable gift to give direction to our lives. . . . The gift to which I refer is known as your patriarchal blessing" (Thomas S. Monson, "Your Patriarchal Blessing: A Liahona of Light," Ensign, Nov. 1986, 65).</p>
<heading>Likening the scriptures to ourselves.</heading>
<p>Elder Robert D. Hales taught:
"Several years ago I was teaching our young son about the life and experiences of the brother of Jared. Although the story was very interesting, he was not engaged. I then asked what the story meant to him personally. It means so much when we ask our children, «What does it mean to you?» He said, «You know, it's not that different from what Joseph Smith did in the grove when he prayed and got an answer.»
"I said, «You're about Joseph's age. Do you think a prayer like his would be helpful to you?» Suddenly, we weren't talking about a long-ago story in a faraway land. We were talking about our son — about his life, his needs, and the way prayer could help him.
"As parents, we have the responsibility to help our children to «liken all scriptures [indeed, every part of the gospel of Jesus Christ] unto us [and unto our children],. . . for [the] profit and learning [of our families]»" ("With All the Feeling of a Tender Parent: A Message of Hope to Families," Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 90).</p>
<heading>Suggestions for likening the scriptures.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Think about events or circumstances in our day that are similar to those in the scriptures you are reading.</li>
<li>Look for what people know, learn, or do in the scriptures that could help you with a current personal problem or question.</li>
<li>Identify principles from that story that can help you in your own circumstances.</li>

<heading type="title">"WE LIVED AFTER THE MANNER OF HAPPINESS"</heading>
<p>Begin your spiritual preparation by reading 2 Nephi 1–5 and recording your impressions. There are more principles in these chapters than you have time to discuss in one class, so follow the Spirit in your preparation and pay attention to the insights shared by class members to help you determine which principles to focus on and how to guide the conversation.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>It is likely that members of your class have marked or made a note about at least one verse in 2 Nephi 1–5. To start the class, you could invite class members to share verses that were meaningful to them. Invite the class to summarize a doctrinal principle they learn from the verses shared.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>2 NEPHI 2:11–30</heading>
<heading>We are free to act for ourselves.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Too often, people use their agency to cause much suffering to others. So why is agency so important to Heavenly Father? Maybe you could write this question on the board, and class members could search for answers in 2 Nephi 2:11–30 and write their answers on the board. How does the adversary try to undermine our agency? How does the Savior help us "choose liberty and eternal life"? (2 Nephi 2:27). Consider singing together a hymn about agency, such as "Know This, That Every Soul Is Free" (Hymns, no. 240), and inviting class members to add to their list other insights they gain from the hymn.</li>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families identifies four essential conditions that make agency possible. Here's one way you could build on what class members may have learned at home: Write the four conditions on the board. Then invite class members to share statements from 2 Nephi 2 that teach why these conditions are essential to reaching our divine potential.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 2:15–29</heading>
<heading>The Fall and the Atonement of Jesus Christ are essential parts of Heavenly Father's plan.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many Christians believe that the Fall was a tragedy and that Eve made a terrible mistake. These verses in 2 Nephi 2 clarify truths about the Fall of Adam and Eve, and they testify that Jesus Christ redeems us from the Fall. One way to discuss these ideas is to invite class members to search 2 Nephi 2:15–25 and make a list of truths they learn about what happened in the Garden of Eden. What other insights do they find in the quote from President Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources"? How did Jesus Christ redeem us from the Fall? (see 2 Nephi 2:6–8, 26–29).</li>
<li>After doing an activity like the previous one, you could display several questions like the following and invite class members to share their insights:
<ul>
<li>How do Lehi's teachings in these verses correct some common misunderstandings about the Fall?</li>
<li>In what ways is the Fall a blessing?</li>
<li>How does correctly understanding the Fall help us better understand our need for Jesus Christ and His Atonement?</li>
<li>What is one reason you are grateful for Adam and Eve's choice in the Garden of Eden?</li>
<li>How was your choice to come to earth similar to Adam and Eve's choice to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil?</li>
<li>What is the purpose of life? Why was the Fall necessary to achieve this purpose?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 4:15–35</heading>
<heading>We can turn to God in our weakness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Nephi's writings in 2 Nephi 4:15–35 can bring us hope and comfort when we feel overwhelmed by our struggles and weaknesses. Perhaps class members could review these verses in pairs and find passages that they could use to comfort someone who feels burdened by his or her afflictions. Then each pair could share these passages with the class. Maybe someone in the class could share an experience in which he or she found comfort by turning to God, as Nephi did.</li>
<li>Another way to review 2 Nephi 4 could be to invite a few class members ahead of time to come prepared to share verses and phrases from this chapter that were meaningful to them. Ask them to share what they do when they feel overwhelmed by their weaknesses. A hymn about comfort and hope, such as "Where Can I Turn for Peace?" (Hymns, no. 129), could add to this discussion. For example, class members could share how the hymn reinforces Nephi's example of relying on the Lord in times of discouragement.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 5</heading>
<heading>Happiness is found in living the gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Despite the challenges Nephi and his people faced, they were able to build a society based on principles that lead to happiness. What principles did class members find in their study of 2 Nephi 5 that contributed to the happiness the Nephites experienced? You could provide a piece of paper to class members and invite them to search 2 Nephi 5 for principles that lead to happiness and write them down. How are the ways the world seeks happiness different from what we find in 2 Nephi 5? What goals can class members set to apply one of these principles?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Tell class members that 2 Nephi 6–10 has one of the best sermons about the Atonement of Jesus Christ in all of scripture. You could also share a verse you find in these chapters that makes you excited to read it.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>The Fall was part of God's plan.</heading>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks taught:
"When Adam and Eve received the first commandment, they were in a transitional state, no longer in the spirit world but with physical bodies not yet subject to death and not yet capable of procreation. They could not fulfill the Father's first commandment without transgressing the barrier between the bliss of the Garden of Eden and the terrible trials and wonderful opportunities of mortal life. . . .
". . . The Prophet Lehi explained that «if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen» (2 Ne. 2:22), but would have remained in the same state in which he was created.
". . . The Fall was planned, Lehi concludes, because «all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things» (2 Ne. 2:24).
"It was Eve who first transgressed the limits of Eden in order to initiate the conditions of mortality. Her act, whatever its nature, was formally a transgression but eternally a glorious necessity to open the doorway toward eternal life. Adam showed his wisdom by doing the same. And thus Eve and «Adam fell that men might be» (2 Ne. 2:25).
"Some Christians condemn Eve for her act, concluding that she and her daughters are somehow flawed by it. Not the Latter-day Saints! Informed by revelation, we celebrate Eve's act and honor her wisdom and courage in the great episode called the Fall. . . .
"Modern revelation shows that our first parents understood the necessity of the Fall. Adam declared, «Blessed be the name of God, for because of my transgression my eyes are opened, and in this life I shall have joy, and again in the flesh I shall see God» (Moses 5:10)" ("The Great Plan of Happiness, "Ensign, Nov. 1993, 72–73).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Reach out to those who do not attend.</b>Teaching is more than leading a discussion on Sunday; it involves ministering with love and blessing others with the gospel. Maybe you could think of someone who is not attending and give him or her a specific invitation to participate in an upcoming lesson. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 8–9.)</p>

<p>Jacob taught his people that the teachings of Isaiah "may be likened unto you" (2 Nephi 6:5). You could begin by asking class members to share any of Jacob's teachings in 2 Nephi 6–10 that they feel they can liken to their lives. They could explain why they find the teaching meaningful.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>2 NEPHI 6–8</heading>
<heading>The Lord is merciful to His people and will fulfill His promises.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To give some context to the messages of 2 Nephi 6–8, it might be helpful for your class to create a simple time line of the events described in 2 Nephi 6:8–15. What do these events suggest about the Lord and His feelings for His people? (see also 2 Nephi 7:1–3; 8:3). You may want to explain that as Church members, we are God's covenant people today, and we are being gathered out of the world into the safety of the gospel. What messages do these chapters have for us now?</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 9</heading>
<heading>Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ delivers all people from physical and spiritual death.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One way to deepen our appreciation for the Atonement of Jesus Christ is to think about what would have happened to us without the Atonement. Class members can ponder these things as they study 2 Nephi 9. You could invite class members to begin by studying verses 4–9 and then listing on the board what would have happened without Christ's Atonement. According to verses 10–14, how did the Savior rescue us from this fate? Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's message in "Additional Resources" can help your class understand our need for the Atonement of Jesus Christ. You could also show the video based on his message — "Where Justice, Love, and Mercy Meet" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Class members could share any thoughts or feelings that Elder Holland's message inspires about the Savior.</li>
<li>Ask class members to consider how they would explain the Atonement of Jesus Christ to someone who does not know what it is or why it is necessary. The truths found in 2 Nephi 9 could help prepare class members for such a conversation. Perhaps they could search verses 4–12, looking for how the Savior's Atonement overcomes physical and spiritual death. Based on what we learn from these scriptures, why is the Savior's sacrifice called "an infinite atonement"? (2 Nephi 9:7).</li>
<li>Jacob was so awed by God's plan of redemption that he was led to exclaim "O how great" and "O the greatness" as he described the plan. To help class members better understand these feelings for the Savior and His Atonement, consider inviting them to search 2 Nephi 9 for Jacob's exclamations (most of them are found in verses 8–20).
<li>What do these verses teach about God and His plan? What experiences have helped us feel what Jacob felt about God's plan for His children? You could also sing a song about the greatness of God, such as "How Great Thou Art" (Hymns, no. 86), to reinforce this discussion.</li></li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 9:27–54</heading>
<heading>We can come unto Christ and receive the glorious blessings of His Atonement.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You could begin a discussion of Jacob's teachings in these verses by asking class members to imagine how they would invite someone to repent and come unto Christ. How did Jacob do this in 2 Nephi 9:50–53? What blessings did he say will come into our lives as we accept these invitations?</li>
<li>In 2 Nephi 9, Jacob used two powerful and contrasting phrases: "the merciful plan of the great Creator" and "that cunning plan of the evil one" (2 Nephi 9:6, 28). To help class members learn from this contrast, you could draw a path on the board and label it<i>Heavenly Father's Plan</i>. Invite class members to search 2 Nephi 9:27–52, looking for the counsel Jacob gave to help us follow Heavenly Father's plan. Ask them to write what they find beside the path. What did Jacob teach about how Satan lures us away from the plan of our Heavenly Father? What do we learn from these verses about where following Heavenly Father's plan will lead us and where following Satan will lead? (see 2 Nephi 9:9, 18). According to these verses, what can we do to more fully follow the plan of our Heavenly Father?</li>
<li>In 2 Nephi 9:28–38, Jacob warned against several attitudes and behaviors that keep us from following God's plan for us. Consider inviting class members to find them. Which of these attitudes and behaviors seem especially prevalent today? What makes them so dangerous? What do we learn from 2 Nephi 9:50–53 about how to avoid these dangers?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To help class members feel confident about reading the writings of Isaiah quoted by Nephi in 2 Nephi 11–24, you could explain that Nephi included these writings to strengthen his people's faith in Jesus Christ. Invite class members to look at next week's reading as an opportunity to build their own faith in Him.</p>

<heading>Our need for a Savior.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland told the story of a rock climber who was hanging precariously from a steep canyon ledge, with nothing to keep him from falling to his death. Just as his grip began slipping on the sandy surface of the ledge, he felt his younger brother's hands grasp his wrists and pull him to safety. Elder Holland compared the climber's experience to our condition in this fallen world:
"There was an actual Adam and Eve who fell from an actual Eden, with all the consequences that fall carried with it. . . . Because we were then born into that fallen world and because we too would transgress the laws of God, we also were sentenced to the same penalties that Adam and Eve faced. 
"What a plight! The entire human race in free fall — every man, woman, and child in it physically tumbling toward permanent death, spiritually plunging toward eternal anguish. Is that what life was meant to be? Is this the grand finale of the human experience? Are we all just hanging in a cold canyon somewhere in an indifferent universe, each of us searching for a toehold, each of us seeking for something to grip — with nothing but the feeling of sand sliding under our fingers, nothing to save us, nothing to hold on to, much less anything to hold on to us? . . .
"The answer to those questions is an unequivocal and eternal no! . . . [The] Atonement would achieve complete victory over physical death, unconditionally granting resurrection to every person who has been born or ever will be born into this world. Mercifully it would also provide forgiveness for the personal sins of all, from Adam to the end of the world, conditioned upon repentance and obedience to divine commandments" ("Where Justice, Love, and Mercy Meet," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 105–6).</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Before discussing specific passages from 2 Nephi 11–25, it might be helpful to ask class members to imagine they have a friend who struggles to find anything meaningful or inspiring in the writings of Isaiah. What verses would they share with this friend?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>2 NEPHI 11–24</heading>
<heading>Isaiah testified of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It can be easier to understand Isaiah's prophecies when we know why they were written. To begin a discussion of Isaiah's prophecies in 2 Nephi, you might invite class members to search chapter 11 and list several of Nephi's purposes for quoting Isaiah so extensively. They could also share passages they found in their personal or family study of 2 Nephi 12–24 that they feel achieved those purposes. How has understanding Nephi's purposes helped class members get more out of the writings of Isaiah? Encourage them to keep these purposes in mind as they discuss Isaiah's writings in class.</li>
<li>Because Isaiah used so much symbolic language, it can be easy to overlook his powerful witness of Jesus Christ. Here's an activity that can help your class focus on this witness. You could prepare several papers with scripture references written on them from 2 Nephi 12–24 that teach about the Savior (for example, 2 Nephi 13:13; 14:4–6; 15:1–7; 16:1–7; 17:14; 18:14–15; 19:6–7; 21:1–5; 22:2). Each class member could select one of the papers, study the verses written on it, and write on the paper what he or she learned about Jesus Christ. Then class members could exchange papers with someone else and add any further thoughts or insights they learned about the Savior from the same verses. You could then give class members a chance to share what they learned from Isaiah and from each other that deepened their appreciation for Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>The prophecy in 2 Nephi 19:6 lists several titles of Jesus Christ. Consider asking someone to list them on the board and inviting class members to discuss why each of these titles is a fitting description of the Savior. How has He fulfilled these roles in our lives? To learn more about some of these titles, it might be helpful to look up the references in the footnotes for 2 Nephi 19:6.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 12:2–5; 21:10–12; 22</heading>
<heading>In the latter days, God's people will be gathered and enjoy peace.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Certain parts of Isaiah's prophecies are especially relevant to us because they describe aspects of God's latter-day work. For example, you could examine 2 Nephi 21:10–12, which describes an "ensign" (standard or banner) that will be raised to gather God's people. How have we seen the Lord gather His people spiritually? Maybe some class members could talk about what makes them want to gather or unite with God's people in the Church. They might even enjoy creating their own banners that list or illustrate some of the truths of the gospel that they feel people "seek" and will help "assemble" and "gather together" (verses 10 and 12) God's children in our day. How do we help with the gathering?</li>
<li>Another way to discuss this doctrine is to write the following themes on the board:<i>Scattering of Israel, Gathering of Israel,</i>and<i>Prophecies of Christ.</i>You might assign chapters from 2 Nephi 12–24 to groups of class members and invite them to find verses that teach about these things and write these verses under the appropriate heading on the board. What messages do these verses have for us? (It might be helpful to tell class members that Doctrine and Covenants 113:1–6 can help them understand 2 Nephi 21:1–5, 10.)</li>
<li>Hymns such as "High on the Mountain Top" (Hymns, no. 5) or "The Lord Is My Light" (Hymns, no. 89), which are based in part on the prophecies in 2 Nephi 12:2–5 and 2 Nephi 22, can reinforce the messages and spirit of Isaiah's words.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 14:4–6</heading>
<heading>Our homes and "assemblies" of Zion can be places of safety and refuge.</heading>
<ul>
<li>In 2 Nephi 14:4–6 Isaiah prophesied about the safety and peace that the righteous will enjoy after the Lord has "washed away" and "purged" their sins. Although these verses describe conditions that will exist in the Millennium, they could help class members as they seek spiritual safety in the midst of latter-day wickedness. Invite them to ponder and discuss what it means to have "a cloud and smoke" and "a flaming fire" on their "dwelling-place" and "assemblies" (verse 5; see also Exodus 13:21–22). What are some things that might be compared to the heat, storm, and rain mentioned in verse 6? How can we find refuge? (see also D&amp;C 115:6). Perhaps class members could suggest ways to make sure our homes and Church gatherings are places of spiritual protection.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 25:19–29</heading>
<heading>"The right way is to believe in Christ."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Your class members can likely relate to Nephi's desire "to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ." How did Nephi "labor diligently" to accomplish this goal? (2 Nephi 25:23). Maybe class members could search 2 Nephi 25:19–29 to find truths about the Savior and His gospel that Nephi wanted his people to know. Then they could share what they have done to teach these truths to their family or friends. For example, how have they taught the truth that "it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do"? (The statement by President Dieter F. Uchtdorf in "Additional Resources" can provide some insight on this truth.) How have they helped others "rejoice in Christ"?</li>
</ul>

<heading>"It is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do."</heading>
<p>Commenting on Nephi's words in 2 Nephi 25:23, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said:
"I wonder if sometimes we misinterpret the phrase «after all we can do.» We must understand that «after» does not equal «because.»
"We are not saved «because» of all that we can do. Have any of us done<i>all</i>that we can do? Does God wait until we've expended every effort before He will intervene in our lives with His saving grace? . . .
"I am certain Nephi knew that the Savior's grace allows and enables us to overcome sin [see 2 Nephi 4:19–35; Alma 34:31]. This is why Nephi labored so diligently to persuade his children and brethren «to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God» [2 Nephi 25:23]. 
"After all, that is what we can do! And that is our task in mortality!" ("The Gift of Grace," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 110).</p>

<p>At the beginning of the lesson, give class members a chance to share something from 2 Nephi 26–30 that they found meaningful as they studied at home. For example, you could ask them to briefly share a verse that helped them understand our day and the challenges we face.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>2 NEPHI 26:24–28, 33</heading>
<heading>Everything the Lord does is motivated by His love for us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>If you feel inspired to discuss Nephi's teachings about the Lord's love, you could try this: After reading 2 Nephi 26:24 together, invite class members to make lists of things that Jesus Christ has done for them that were motivated by love. How does He "draw all men unto him"? What do we feel ins to do in response to His expressions of love?</li>
<li>The Lord's invitations in 2 Nephi 26:24–28, 33 are powerful evidence of His love. One way you might help class members discover these invitations is to ask them to condense the Lord's message in these verses into a one-sentence summary. Perhaps a few class members would be willing to share their summaries. How might these verses influence the way we invite others to come unto Christ? Encourage the class to record some of their thoughts and feelings. To help invite the Spirit, consider playing a recording of a hymn about the Savior's love, such as "Come unto Jesus" (Hymns, no. 117), while class members are pondering.</li>
</ul>
<heading>2 NEPHI 27; 29; 30:3–8</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon is essential to God's latter-day work.</heading>
<ul>
<li>People in your class may need a little help understanding the prophecy in 2 Nephi 27 about a sealed book and a learned man. The historical account in "Additional Resources" might help. Would it work for your class if a few class members briefly dramatized the events described in this account and in 2 Nephi 27:15–22? Why might Nephi have been shown these events so many years in advance? What does Nephi's prophecy teach us about the importance of the Book of Mormon? Encourage class members to share with each other how they gained their own testimonies of the Book of Mormon.</li>
<li>Has anyone in your class had an experience with inviting someone to read the Book of Mormon that they could share? What are some reasons someone might not accept an invitation to read the Book of Mormon? The Lord's response to one such reason is found in 2 Nephi 29:6–11. You could invite class members to read these verses and then role-play how they might lovingly respond to someone who says that the Book of Mormon is not necessary. What other ideas do class members have about how they can help others "know that [the Book of Mormon] is a blessing unto them from the hand of God"? (2 Nephi 30:6).</li>

<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests searching for Satan's lies described in 2 Nephi 28. Perhaps class members could share what they found, or they could scan 2 Nephi 28 in class and list Satan's lies that they identify. It might also be helpful to let them work in small groups to find scriptures that refute these deceptions (if they need help, you could share the suggestions in "Additional Resources"). Then the groups could share with each other what they found and discuss how they can detect the adversary's "false and vain and foolish doctrines" (2 Nephi 28:9).</li>

<heading>"Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it" (2 Nephi 27:18).</heading>
<p>In February 1828, Martin Harris, a friend of Joseph Smith, took a "journey east to New York City with a transcription of some of the characters on the [golden] plates to show them to scholars. Perhaps he wanted additional reassurance that the plates were authentic, or he may have thought a testimonial would help them borrow money to publish the translation. In any event, he insisted that the Lord had prompted him to make the trip.
"At the time, neither Joseph nor Martin knew much about the language on the plates. They knew only as much as the angel Moroni had told Joseph: that it was an ancient American record. Thus, rather than seeking a scholar with a knowledge of Egyptian (Joseph later learned that the language on the plates was called «reformed Egyptian»), Martin visited several scholars with an interest in antiquities, especially American antiquities.
". . . [Among the scholars Martin visited was] Charles Anthon, a young professor of grammar and linguistics at Columbia College. Anthon had been collecting American Indian stories and speeches for publication and was eager to inspect the document Martin brought him.
"Martin claimed that Anthon declared the characters authentic until he learned how Joseph Smith had acquired them. He suggested Martin bring him the plates. Martin refused, and Anthon replied, paraphrasing a verse in Isaiah, «I cannot read a sealed book.» Though Anthon later denied the details of Martin's account of their meeting, we do know this: Martin came away from his visits with the eastern scholars more convinced than ever that Joseph Smith was called of God and that the plates and characters were ancient. He and Joseph viewed the visit to Anthon as a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy (also mentioned in the Book of Mormon itself) of «a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed» [Isaiah 29:11; see also 2 Nephi 27:15–18]" ("The Contributions of Martin Harris," Revelations in Context [2016], 3–4, history.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</p>

<heading>Jesus Christ and His doctrine are the only way to eternal life.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps it would benefit your class to see how faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end relate to each other and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. To do this, you could draw a path on the board and invite class members to write along the path some of the principles found in 2 Nephi 31. Each class member could select one of these principles and search 2 Nephi 31–32 to find something that Nephi taught about it. Then they could share with each other what they found and discuss how it helps them understand the principles better. How does living these principles bring the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ into our lives?</li>
<li>How might you begin a discussion on Nephi's plain and simple description of "the way" to salvation? (2 Nephi 31:21). Perhaps you could ask class members what they would say if they only had 60 seconds to explain what a person mu do to receive salvation. Then class members could scan 2 Nephi 31–32, looking for statements that could help. What do we learn from these chapters about the Savior's central role in our salvation? The statements in "Additional Resources" could be helpful to this conversation.</li>
<li>Sometimes we see gospel principles as distinct and separate, but in reality they are interrelated. To help class members see how the principles in 2 Nephi 31 are connected, invite class members, individually or in small groups, to read verses 4–21 and create a diagram that shows how faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end build on each other, relate to each other, and so on. Encourage them to be creative. As they share their diagrams with the class, ask them to share what they learned about these principles. How can we make them part of our daily lives?</li>

<heading>The doctrine of Christ.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: "The «doctrine of Christ» as taught by Nephi in his grand, summational discourse focuses on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. It does not, in this declaration, attempt to cover the entire plan of salvation, all the virtues of a Christian life, or the rewards that await us in differing degrees of heavenly glory. It does not, in this declaration, deal with the offices of the priesthood, the ordinances of the temple, or many other true doctrines. All these are important, but as used in the Book of Mormon, «the doctrine of Christ» is simple and direct. It focuses on the first principles of the gospel exclusively, including an expression of encouragement to endure, to persist, to press on. Indeed, it is in the clarity and simplicity of «the doctrine of Christ» that its impact is found" (Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 49–50).</p>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson said: "I appeal to all. . . to seek through prayer and study of the scriptures [a] witness of the divine character, the Atonement, and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Accept His doctrine by repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and then throughout your life following the laws and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ" ("The Doctrine of Christ," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 89).</p>
<heading>Enduring to the end.</heading>
<p>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained:
"When I was a young boy, «endure to the end» meant to me mainly that I had to try harder to stay awake until the end of our Church meetings. Later as a teenager . . . I linked it with youthful empathy to the efforts of our dear elderly members to hang in there until the end of their lives. . . .
". . . Enduring to the end is not just a matter of passively tolerating life's difficult circumstances or «hanging in there.» Ours is an active religion, helping God's children along the strait and narrow path to develop their full potential during this life and return to Him one day. Viewed from this perspective, enduring to the end is exalting and glorious, not grim and gloomy. This is a joyful religion, one of hope, strength, and deliverance. . .
"Enduring to the end implies «patient continuance in well doing» (Romans 2:7), striving to keep the commandments (see 2 Nephi 31:10), and doing the works of righteousness (see D&amp;C 59:23)" ("Have We Not Reason to Rejoice?" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 20).</p>

<heading type="title">BE RECONCILED UNTO GOD THROUGH THE ATONEMENT OF CHRIST</heading>
<p>Jacob 1–4 contains many teachings that apply to our day. As you read these chapters, consider how you can help those you teach live the doctrine Jacob taught.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To help class members share insights from Jacob 1–4, you could pass out slips of paper and invite class members to write a scripture reference from these chapters that they found meaningful. Put the slips into a container, draw out a few, and invite the people who wrote the references to share their insights.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>JACOB 1:6–8, 15–19; 2:1–11; 4:18</heading>
<heading>Righteous leaders labor diligently for the welfare of souls.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You might begin a discussion about Jacob's diligent labors among his people by asking class members to share experiences when they were blessed by the service of a Church leader. Or consider asking a local Church leader — past or present to talk about a time when he or she felt inspired to serve someone. Class members could then find words and phrases in Jacob 1:6–8, 15–19; 2:1–11; and 4:18 that help us understand how Jacob felt about his calling and the people he served. How have we seen our leaders magnify their callings? What do these verses suggest about the way we should sustain our leaders?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Like Jacob, Church leaders today "magnify [their] office unto the Lord."</graphics-caption>
<heading>JACOB 2:12–21</heading>
<heading>We should avoid pride and reach out to those in need.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Lord had strong warnings for the Nephites about pride. To help begin a discussion on this topic, you could contact a few class members in advance and ask them to look for ways the adversary promotes the love of riches in our world today. Then invite them to share with the class what they noticed. Class members could work in pairs to read Jacob 2:12–21 and find what the Lord taught about how we should view material wealth. They could then create and share a poster that promotes that principle. Provide time for class members to ponder individually what they can do to apply what they learn from Jacob's message.</li>
<li>Your class members could review Jacob 2:12–21 and write their own questions to add to Elder Perry's list in "Additional Resources." What does Elder Perry's statement add to our understanding of Jacob's teachings?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JACOB 2:23–35</heading>
<heading>The Lord delights in chastity.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Elder David A. Bednar taught that we live "in a world that increasingly mocks the sanctity of procreation and minimizes the worth of human life" ("We Believe in Being Chaste," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 41–44). How might you help class members use Jacob 2:23–35 to counteract the world's messages about chastity? One way might be to write on the board<i>How does the Lord feel about chastity?</i>and invite class members to find answers to the question. Some of them could search Jacob 2:23–35, and the others could search Elder Bednar's talk referenced above. They could list on the board the answers they find. To discuss standards and blessings associated with living the law of chastity, you might review "Sexual Purity" (For the Strength of Youth, 35–37) or show one of the videos listed in "Additional Resources." What are the blessings of living a chaste life?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JACOB 4:4–11</heading>
<heading>The Nephites believed in Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Jacob wanted us to know that even though he and his people lived hundreds of years before the Savior's mortal ministry, they knew of Him and looked to Him for salvation. According to Jacob 4:4–5, why did the Nephites keep the law of Moses? What do we have in our day that points our souls to the Savior? What symbols or similitudes did Jacob use to teach about Jesus Christ? (see also Genesis 22:1–13).</li>
</ul>
<heading>JACOB 4:8–18</heading>
<heading>I can avoid spiritual blindness by focusing on the Savior.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Has anyone in your class recently had an eye exam? If so, you might ask this person to describe how the doctor assessed his or her vision. Class members could share what they think it means to be spiritually blind. How is spiritual blindness similar to physical blindness? Invite class members to suggest ways we can assess whether we are spiritually blind. They could also review Jacob 4:8–18 and suggest some things we can do to increase our ability to "see" spiritual things.</li>
<li>Elder Quentin L. Cook outlined four ways people might look "beyond the mark" in our day (see "Additional Resources"). What do his words add to our understanding of Jacob 4:13–15? What does it mean to look beyond the mark? How can we avoid looking beyond the mark?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Jacob 5–7, tell them that they will find the answer to the question in Jacob 4:17 as they prayerfully read the next three chapters.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Our attitudes toward material wealth.</heading>
<p>Referring to Jacob 2:13–19, Elder L. Tom Perry taught:
"We need to take Jacob's counsel to heart. We should read this scripture as though it were written expressly for us in these days, because it was. His words should cause us to ask soul-searching questions of ourselves. Is the order of things right in our own lives? Are we investing, first and foremost, in the things that are eternal in nature? Do we have an eternal perspective? Or have we fallen into the trap of investing in the things of this world first and then forgetting the Lord?" ("United in Building the Kingdom of God," Ensign, May 1987, 34).</p>

<ul>
<li>"I Choose to Be Pure"</li>
<li>"Chastity: What Are the Limits?"</li>
<li>"Law of Chastity"</li>
</ul>
<heading>Looking beyond the mark.</heading>
<p>Elder Quentin L. Cook taught how we might look "beyond the mark":
<b>'Substituting the philosophies of men for gospel truths'</b>
"Some people seem to be embarrassed by the simplicity of the Savior's message. They want to add complexity and even obscurity to the truth to make it more intellectually challenging or more compatible with current academic trends. . . . We look beyond the mark when we refuse to accept simple gospel truths for what they are."
<b>'Gospel extremism'</b>
"We are looking beyond the mark when we elevate any one principle, no matter how worthwhile it may be, to a prominence that lessens our commitment to other equally important principles or when we take a position that is contrary to the teachings of the Brethren."
<b>'Heroic gestures as a substitute for daily consecration'</b>
"Some members profess that they would commit themselves with enthusiasm if given some great calling, but they do not find home teaching or visiting teaching [now called ministering] worthy of or sufficiently heroic for their sustained effort."
<b>'Elevating rules over doctrine'</b>
"Those who are committed to following rules without reference to doctrine and principle are particularly susceptible to looking beyond the mark" ("Looking beyond the Mark," Ensign or Liahona, Mar. 2003, 42–44).</p>

<graphics-caption>Allegory of the Olive Tree, by Brad Teare</graphics-caption>
<heading type="date">MARCH 16–22</heading>
<heading type="ref">Jacob 5–7</heading>
<heading type="title">THE LORD LABORS WITH US</heading>
<p>Begin your preparation to teach by reading Jacob 5–7 personally and with your family. What did you learn that would be of most benefit for those you teach? This outline can give you additional ideas.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>What did class members find in Jacob 5–7 that inspired them to "labor in the vineyard" where they live? (Jacob 5:15).</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>JACOB 5</heading>
<heading>The Lord invites His servants to labor with Him in His vineyard.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Because the allegory of the olive trees is long and somewhat complex, you might want to work together as a class to create a brief overview of the allegory. For example, you could draw the main elements of the allegory on the board or create a time line of events (for an example, see the diagram at the end of this outline). Class members could add scripture references or descriptions to the drawing and discuss what some of the symbols might mean, such as the tame and wild olive trees, the Lord of the vineyard, the servant, and the good and bad fruit. During this discussion, review verses 61–75, which describe the Lord's work in our day. How are we serving in the Lord's vineyard? How do these verses relate to the work we are doing?</li>
<li>The words of the "Lord of the vineyard" could provide comfort for parents of wayward children. For example, what does Jacob 5:41, 46–47 suggest about how our Father in Heaven feels about His children who go astray? How does He try to save them? (see verses 61–75).</li>
<li>Jacob 5:61–75 teaches that the Lord works alongside His servants in His vineyard. Class members could read these verses in small groups and discuss experiences that have shown them that the Lord is working with His servants to move forward His work. What additional insights can class members add from President Henry B. Eyring's message "The Lord Leads His Church"? (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 81–84).</li>
</ul>
<heading>JACOB 6:3–13</heading>
<heading>The Lord remembers His people in love and mercy.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families invites us to search Jacob 6:3–5 for the messages Jacob wanted to emphasize and then find those messages in the allegory of the olive trees (see Jacob 5). Perhaps class members would benefit from hearing from those who did this activity or from doing this activity as a class. They could list on the board the gospel truths they find in Jacob 6. Then, under each truth, they could list verses from the allegory in Jacob 5 that communicate that message. How have class members seen these same messages illustrated in their own lives?</li>
<li>One meaning of the word cleave is to adhere to something firmly, closely, and unwaveringly. You might want to share this definition with your class and ask what insights it gives them about Jacob 6:5.</li>
</ul>
<heading>JACOB 7:1–23</heading>
<heading>We can stand strong when others challenge our faith.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Most of us have experienced opposition to our faith such as Jacob faced when he met with Sherem. One way to help class members prepare for such opposition is to have them search Jacob 7:1–23 for principles that helped Jacob stand strong. What other examples of standing strong in our faith can we share — from the scriptures, our family history, or our own lives? Perhaps there are messages from Church leaders that have helped us when others sought to shake us from our faith (see, for example, Quentin L. Cook, "Valiant in the Testimony of Jesus," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 40–43). Encourage class members to share messages they have found helpful.</li>
<li>When Jacob was confronted by Sherem, Sherem hoped to shake Jacob from his faith, but Jacob's faith was unshakable (see Jacob 7:5). Class members might enjoy acting out the interaction between Jacob and Sherem, using Jacob 7:1–23 as a script. What do we learn from these verses about the tactics and teachings of those who oppose the work of God? What do we learn from Jacob about how to become more unshakable in our faith?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JACOB 7:24–25</heading>
<heading>We can trust in God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Nephites lived under constant threat of attack from the Lamanites. Though we may not face the daily threat of physical warfare, what spiritual dangers do we face? What do we learn from the Nephites' response to their situation, described in Jacob 7:24–25? You may want to sing or read and then discuss Church hymns that use battles as a metaphor, such as "Onward, Christian Soldiers" or "Behold! A Royal Army" (Hymns, nos. 246, 251).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read the book of Enos, tell them that it can teach them how to make their prayers more meaningful.</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Center your teaching on doctrine.</b>Make sure your class discussions focus on the foundational doctrine in the scriptures. You can do this by asking class members to read scriptures and then share the truths they found, as well as their experiences with living those truths. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 20–21.)</p>

<heading type="ref">Enos–Words of Mormon</heading>
<heading type="title">HE WORKS IN ME TO DO HIS WILL</heading>
<p>Prepare to teach by reading Enos–Words of Mormon and creating a teaching plan (see Teaching in the Savior's Way, 19). The suggestions and doctrines in this outline can also help give you ideas.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To give class members opportunities to share what they are learning at home, you could divide them into groups and assign each group to read one of the chapters from Enos — Words of Mormon. Ask them to suggest verses from that chapter that they feel the class should discuss. List these verses on the board, and choose a few to discuss.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ENOS 1:1–17</heading>
<heading>We can receive forgiveness of our sins as we exercise faith in Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Here are some questions you could invite class members to ponder and discuss as you study Enos 1:1–17: What do we learn from Enos's experiences about receiving a remission of our sins? How did Enos demonstrate his faith in Jesus Christ? How did this experience affect Enos and how he viewed himself and others?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ENOS 1:4–17</heading>
<heading>Our heartfelt prayers will be answered.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members deepen their understanding of prayer, you could divide them into small groups and invite each group to study one of the following passages from Enos 1: verses 2–8, 9–11, or 12–17. Then ask each group to teach the rest of the class something they learned about prayer from their assigned verses. For example, you might invite them to share words and phrases that describe how Enos prayed.</li>
<li>In addition to learning about<i>how</i>Enos prayed, we can also learn much from<i>what</i>Enos prayed about. Perhaps class members could identify who or what Enos prayed for in Enos 1:4–17. According to these verses, why did Enos desire to pray for others? What other truths about prayer do we learn from Enos?</li>
</ul>
<heading>JAROM–OMNI</heading>
<heading>If we keep the commandments, we will prosper.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Jarom and the writers of Omni wrote about the Nephite nation, but their messages apply also to individuals. What do we learn from the books of Jarom and Omni about how righteousness leads to prosperity? (for example, see Jarom 1:7–12 and Omni 1:5–7, 12–18). It might help for class members to define prosperity using a dictionary and the scriptures (for example, see Alma 37:13; 48:15). How does the world's definition compare to the Lord's definition? How does the Lord help His people prosper?</li>
<li>Just as the Nephite prophets labored diligently to teach the commandments to the people, our latter-day prophets also teach us about the commandments. After reading Jarom 1:9–12, class members could discuss recent teachings of Church leaders that inspire them to keep the commandments. It may be helpful for class members to review recent conference messages in Church magazines or on the Gospel Library app. Or they could review the standards discussed in For the Strength of Youth. If needed, you can refer to the list of messages in "Additional Resources." How does obedience to the commandments help us "prosper" in our lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>OMNI</heading>
<heading>The Lord brought many people to the promised land.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Book of Mormon contains a complex history, and keeping track of the different groups of people it describes can be difficult. One way to learn about each of the peoples in the Book of Mormon could be to create a chart on the board and invite the class to fill it in with information about each group of people (such as Nephites, Lamanites, and the people of Zarahemla). For example, the chart could have the following headings:<i>Group name, When and how they arrived,</i>and<i>What happened to them.</i>Discuss together why it is helpful to understand the things you learned about each group. These entries in Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org) can help: "Coriantumr," "Jaredites," "Lamanites," "Mulek," "Nephites," and "Zarahemla."</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Mormon Compiling the Plates, by Jorge Cocco</graphics-caption>
<heading>WORDS OF MORMON 1:1–8</heading>
<heading>God will work through us if we follow His guidance.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As part of a discussion of Words of Mormon, you could invite a class member to come prepared to share why Mormon was inspired to include the small plates (1 Nephi–Omni) in the Book of Mormon. This class member could prepare by reading Words of Mormon and other resources, such as Doctrine and Covenants 10:8–19, 39–45; this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families; and chapter 5 of Saints, volume 1. Encourage the class member to include relevant details about the loss of the 116 pages of the Book of Mormon manuscript and why the small plates were needed to replace the lost pages. What truths do class members learn from this about how the Lord works through man? What do class members find in Words of Mormon 1:1–8 that inspires them to follow direction from God even when they do not have a full understanding of the reasons?</li>
<li>Mormon blessed millions of lives because he followed the Spirit's promptings about the small plates (see Words of Mormon 1:7). Think of ways you can help your class members understand that they can also bless others as they seek to be instruments in God's hands and follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost. How did God work through Mormon? What have class members seen the Lord do through them or others as they have heeded the Spirit and sought to do God's will? The story about President Thomas S. Monson in "Additional Resources" provides an example that might help class members think of examples from their own lives.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>

<heading>"Shake the hand of every child."</heading>
<p>While President Thomas S. Monson was serving as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he spoke to a gathering of Primary children in a Samoan village. Afterward, he was prompted to personally greet each of the 247 children who attended. However, he realized he would not have time; he tried to put the thought of greeting the children out of his mind but could not.
He finally turned to the children's teacher and said, "I would so much like to shake the hand of each boy and each girl. Would this be possible?"
The teacher smiled and spoke to the children in Samoan. They nodded their heads eagerly in response. The teacher then told Elder Monson that when he had learned that one of the Twelve Apostles was to visit Samoa, he had promised the children that if they would pray sincerely and have faith, Elder Monson would visit their village and would be prompted by the Holy Ghost to shake the hand of every child (see Thomas S. Monson, "Friend to Friend: Talofa Lava," Friend, May 1972, 12–13).</p>

<p>Easter Sunday is an excellent opportunity for your class members to strengthen their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Resurrection — and to strengthen one another's testimonies. Keep this in mind as you study the scriptures in preparation for this lesson. Seek spiritual guidance about what will touch the hearts of the people in your class.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Members of your class may have had meaningful experiences over the past two weeks reading what the Book of Mormon teaches about the Resurrection and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Give them a few minutes to find a passage that impressed them, and then invite them to share what they found.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>2 NEPHI 9:7–15; ALMA 11:41–45; 40:21–23</heading>
<heading>Resurrection is the permanent reuniting of the body and the spirit.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Comparisons can be an effective way to teach principles of the gospel. Maybe you could invite class members to read 2 Nephi 9:7–15 and Alma 11:41–45 and identify words and phrases in these verses that teach about resurrection. What is death compared to? How is resurrection described? Why do we need a resurrected body? (see also D&amp;C 93:33–34). Class members could discuss how they might use these comparisons to teach someone about resurrection. As they share their ideas with the class, you could discuss with them why they value these truths about the Resurrection.</li>
<li>Consider inviting class members to share times when they felt thankful for their knowledge about the Resurrection. How could that knowledge influence our lives more regularly? You could help your class members answer this question by inviting each of them to search 2 Nephi 9:7–15; Alma 11:41–45; or Alma 40:21–23 and list on the board truths they find about the Resurrection. Then you could write on the board the following two sentences and ask class members to ponder for a few minutes before sharing how they would complete them:<i>If I did not know these things. . . and Because I know these things. . . .</i></li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Gethsemane, by Michael T. Malm</graphics-caption>
<heading>MOSIAH 3:5–7; 15:5–9; ALMA 7:11–13</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ took upon Himself our sins, pains, and infirmities.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Pondering and discussing the Savior's suffering on our behalf can invite the Spirit and inspire feelings of love and gratitude toward the Savior. To encourage such pondering and discussion, you could draw a chart on the board similar to the one suggested in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families and invite class members to complete it using Mosiah 3:5–7; 15:5–9; and Alma 7:11–13 and their own experiences. As the Spirit directs, you could also invite class members to share their feelings about what Jesus Christ has done for them.</li>
<li>Sacred music can invite the Spirit and reinforce the doctrine you are teaching. Perhaps class members could review Mosiah 3:5–7; 15:5–9; and Alma 7:11–13 and find and sing hymns that they feel match the messages in these verses (you could also invite someone to sing or play the hymns). The scripture index at the back of the hymnbook can help, and other hymns are suggested in "Additional Resources." Encourage class members to share phrases from the hymns and the scriptures that help them appreciate the Savior's sacrifice more deeply.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ENOS 1:1–19; MOSIAH 5:1–2; 27:8–28:4; ALMA 24:7–19</heading>
<heading>The Atonement of Jesus Christ cleanses us and helps perfect us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One effective way to learn about the Savior's power to change our lives is to study examples of how He has changed others' lives as they repented and came unto Him. The Book of Mormon has many such examples. Perhaps you could assign each class member to read about one of these examples, such as Enos (see Enos 1:1–19), King Benjamin's people (see Mosiah 5:1–2), Alma the Younger (see Mosiah 27:8–28:4), or the Anti-Nephi-Lehies (see Alma 24:7–19), or they could think of other examples from the scriptures. Then a few class members could summarize the experiences they read about. Perhaps your class would enjoy doing this by giving clues to help the rest of the class guess who they are describing. They could also discuss questions like these: How did the people in these examples change? What was the Savior's role in their change? Perhaps a few class members could talk about how the Savior has worked "a mighty change . . . in [their] hearts" (Mosiah 5:2). To learn more about how the Savior changes us — and why that change is so important you could share with the class the analogy given by President Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Mosiah 1–3, you might invite them to ponder a time when they felt a desire to rejoice after reading or hearing a gospel message. Invite them to look for truths they can rejoice in as they read Mosiah 1–3.</p>

<heading>Analogy: We must be more than clean.</heading>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks shared an analogy to explain how the Savior prepares us to return to God's presence:
"We tend to think of the results of repentance as simply cleansing us from sin, but that is an incomplete view. . . . A person who sins is like a tree that bends easily in the wind. On a windy and rainy day, the tree bends so deeply against the ground that the leaves become soiled with mud, like sin. If we focus only on cleaning the leaves, the weakness in the tree that allowed it to bend and soil its leaves may remain. Similarly, a person who is merely sorry to be soiled by sin will sin again in the next high wind. The susceptibility to repetition continues until the tree has been strengthened.
"When a person has gone through the process that results in what the scriptures call «a broken heart and a contrite spirit,» the Savior does more than cleanse that person from sin. He gives him or her new strength. That strengthening is essential for us to realize the purpose of the cleansing, which is to return to our Heavenly Father. To be admitted to His presence, we must be more than clean. We must also be changed from a morally weak person who has sinned into a strong person with the spiritual stature to dwell in the presence of God" ("The Atonement and Faith," Ensign, Apr. 2010, 33–34).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Live worthy of the Spirit's guidance.</b>When you live the gospel, you are worthy of the companionship of the Spirit, who is the real teacher. As you seek His guidance, the Holy Ghost will give you thoughts and impressions about how to meet the needs of those you teach. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 5.)</p>

<heading>MOSIAH 2:1–9</heading>
<heading>Receiving the word of God requires preparation.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One way to start a discussion about preparing to receive the word of God might be to talk about the consequences of preparing — or not preparing — for other things. For instance, class members could share experiences about how their preparation or lack of preparation affected an experience they had at school or work or some other activity. After they share, you could invite half of the class to read Mosiah 2:1–9, looking for things King Benjamin's people did to prepare to receive God's word. The other half could search the same verses, looking for things King Benjamin did that show how he felt about God's word and the need to share it. Then ask each group to share their ideas.

<li>King Benjamin was an exemplary servant to God and to those around him. What can your class members learn from him to help them in their efforts to serve others? Consider starting the discussion by asking class members to list obstacles people face in giving service to others — such as reasons we don't serve or reasons our service is not as helpful as it could be. Then they could study Mosiah 2:10–26 and make a list of truths King Benjamin taught about serving others that can help them overcome the obstacles they listed. What can individuals and families do to focus on service in their daily lives? Consider sharing the story by President Thomas S. Monson in "Additional Resources" as one suggestion.</li>
<li>A hymn such as "A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief" (Hymns, no. 29) or a video such as "The Old Shoemaker" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) could reinforce the message found in Mosiah 2:17 — when we serve others, we are serving God. How could you use such resources to reinforce King Benjamin's message? Perhaps class members could share experiences they have had with serving others or receiving someone's Christlike service. As part of your discussion, consider sharing this quotation from President Henry B. Eyring: "When we offer succor to anyone, the Savior feels it as if we reached out to succor Him" ("Is Not This the Fast That I Have Chosen?" Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 22). Why do you think we are serving God when we serve other people?</li>

<heading>MOSIAH 2:38–41</heading>
<heading>Happiness comes from keeping the commandments of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members "consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God," it might help to start with a definition of happiness. How would class members describe the happiness that comes from obedience to God? Perhaps they could imagine that they have a friend who says that he or she is happy without keeping the commandments. Invite them to read Mosiah 2:38–41 and discuss how they could help their friend understand the difference between worldly happiness and eternal happiness. What experiences or examples from people's lives can class members share that exemplify eternal happiness?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 3:1–20</heading>
<heading>Salvation comes only "through the name of Christ, the Lord."</heading>
<ul>
<li>King Benjamin's message includes powerful and descriptive prophecies about the birth, ministry, and atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. You might ask class members to share verses from Mosiah 3:1–20 that particularly impress them and help them understand the Savior and His mission. Ask them to share why these verses impress them.</li>
<li>The introduction to the Book of Mormon teaches that the book "outlines the plan of salvation." To help class members see how King Benjamin's sermon helps accomplish this purpose of the Book of Mormon, you might write on the board<i>Jesus Christ Makes Salvation Possible.</i>Class members could review Mosiah 3:1–20, and then you or they could list on the board the truths they learn about the plan of salvation. Ask class members what they learn about how Jesus Christ makes the plan of salvation possible. Then give class members time to review Mosiah 3:18–19 and share what we must do to become saints and receive salvation. How does the Atonement of Jesus Christ help us accomplish this? Ask class members to share their feelings about the Savior's role in the plan of salvation.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Have your class members ever had an experience when a doctrine taught in a talk, lesson, or scripture changed them? Tell them that in Mosiah 4–6 they will read about the dramatic effect that the truths taught by King Benjamin had on his people.</p>

<heading>Serving others.</heading>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson said:
"A few years ago I read an article written by Jack McConnell, MD. He grew up in the hills of southwest Virginia in the United States as one of seven children of a Methodist minister and a stay-at-home mother. Their circumstances were very humble. He recounted that during his childhood, every day as the family sat around the dinner table, his father would ask each one in turn, «And what did you do for someone today?» The children were determined to do a good turn every day so they could report to their father that they had helped someone. Dr. McConnell calls this exercise his father's most valuable legacy, for<i>that</i>expectation and<i>those</i>words inspired him and his siblings to help others throughout their lives. As they grew and matured, their motivation for providing service changed to an inner desire to help others.
"Besides Dr. McConnell's distinguished medical career he created an organization he calls Volunteers in Medicine, which gives retired medical personnel a chance to volunteer at free clinics serving the working uninsured. Dr. McConnell said his leisure time since he retired has «evaporated into 60–hour weeks of unpaid work, but [his] energy level has increased and there is a satisfaction in [his] life that wasn't there before.» [Jack McConnell, «And What Did You Do for Someone Today?» Newsweek, June 18, 2001, 13.] . . .
"Of course, we can't all be Dr. McConnells, establishing medical clinics to help the poor; however, the needs of others are ever present, and each of us can do something to help someone. . . .
"My brothers and sisters, we are surrounded by those in need of our attention, our encouragement, our support, our comfort, our kindness — be they family members, friends, acquaintances, or strangers. We are the Lord's hands here upon the earth, with the mandate to serve and to lift His children. He is dependent upon each of us. . . . May we ask ourselves the question which greeted Dr. Jack McConnell and his brothers and sisters each evening at dinnertime: «What have I done for someone today?»" ("What Have I Done for Someone Today?" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 84–87).</p>

<p>You may want to begin your class discussion by asking class members to share one of King Benjamin's teachings from Mosiah 4–5 that they would like to better apply in their lives.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MOSIAH 4:1–12</heading>
<heading>Through Jesus Christ, we can receive and retain a remission of our sins.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some people have the mistaken idea that repentance requires little effort; others believe it requires too much effort. To help class members better understand what is required to receive a remission of sins, you could invite them to search King Benjamin's teachings in Mosiah 4:1–12, looking for the conditions under which Heavenly Father grants a remission of our sins. Class members could list on the board what find. Ask them to think of an analogy to help explain what they learned. For example, they could compare remission of sins to a creditor "remitting" or canceling a debt. Or they could compare retaining a remission of our sins to caring for something that needs constant maintenance, such as a garden or a home.</li>
<li>Consider asking class members what they would say to someone who wonders if repentance is worth the effort. How would they help someone who is discouraged and feels that overcoming sin and weakness is impossible? You could help prepare class members for such conversations by asking them to spend a few minutes searching King Benjamin's words in Mosiah 4:1–12 for truths that could help someone in one of these situations. Class members could then share the truths they discovered with someone sitting nearby.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 4:11–27</heading>
<heading>As we repent, we will be filled with the love of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How do we know if we have received a remission of our sins? King Benjamin described some results of true repentance — invite members of your class to find them in Mosiah 4:13–16. You could also invite them to ponder their own lives and evaluate how well they are living the teachings in these verses. What signs do class members see that they are being converted? How do our relationships with others change as we come unto Christ through repentance? Perhaps class members could share how they have seen this happen in their lives.</li>
<li>Mosiah 4:11–12 and 14–16 could prompt a discussion about what inspires righteous parenting. What do these verses teach about how to become better parents?</li>
<li>If you feel inspired to have a discussion about King Benjamin's teachings about caring for the poor and needy, you could invite class members to take turns reading verses from Mosiah 4:16–27. After each verse is read, the person who read could summarize in his or her own words what King Benjamin taught. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's message "Are We Not All Beggars?" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 40–42) could be used to supplement this discussion. How can we follow King Benjamin's counsel to not "run faster than [we have] strength"? (Mosiah 4:26–27). How does the commandment to "impart of [our] substance to the poor" relate to the remission of our sins?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 4:29–30</heading>
<heading>We must watch our thoughts, words, and deeds.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it seems like it would be easier if the Lord gave us a detailed list of every possible sin. Instead, He tells us, "Watch yourselves . . . and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord" (Mosiah 4:30). To help your class discuss this principle, you could ask them questions like these: How do our thoughts, words, and deeds affect ourselves and others? What does it mean to "continue in the faith"? What advice can we share with each other to help us "watch" ourselves?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 5:1–7</heading>
<heading>The Spirit of the Lord can cause a mighty change in our hearts.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To begin a discussion about the incomparable change that the gospel of Jesus Christ can bring to our lives, you could invite class members to share some reasons why it is often difficult to make lasting changes in our lives. Then invite them to read Mosiah 5:1–5, looking for the "mighty change" that King Benjamin's people experienced. What truths about a change of heart do we learn from their experience? Consider asking a few class members to share how the Holy Ghost has helped them change their hearts. You could also watch one of the videos suggested in "Additional Resources."</li>
<li>After discussing the truths in Mosiah 5:1–7, some class members may wonder why their change of heart does not seem as dramatic or immediate as the experience of King Benjamin's people. The statement from Elder D. Todd Christofferson in "Additional Resources" addresses this question. What can we learn from Elder Christofferson about conversion?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Savior can change our hearts and our lives. Healing Hands, by Adam Abram</graphics-caption>
<heading>MOSIAH 5:5–15</heading>
<heading>God invites me to make covenants with Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Mosiah 5:5–15 can help class members understand the blessings they receive when they make and keep covenants with God. You could invite them to review these verses with baptismal covenants and the ordinance of the sacrament in mind and share what they learn. (See also D&amp;C 20:77, 79.)</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Many members of your class may be experiencing or have recently experienced a personal struggle or trial. Tell them that in Mosiah 7–10 they will read about a group of people who learned how to trust the Lord during their times of trial.</p>

<li>"A Change of Heart"</li>
<li>"A Mighty Change: Conversion"</li>
</ul>
<heading>Change is often a process.</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson spoke of the mighty change of heart described in the scriptures:
"You may ask, Why doesn't this mighty change happen more quickly with me? You should remember that the remarkable examples of King Benjamin's people, Alma, and some others in scripture are just that — remarkable and not typical. For most of us, the changes are more gradual and occur over time. Being born again, unlike our physical birth, is more a process than an event. And engaging in that process is the central purpose of mortality.
"At the same time, let us not justify ourselves in a casual effort. Let us not be content to retain some disposition to do evil. Let us worthily partake of the sacrament each week and continue to draw upon the Holy Spirit to root out the last vestiges of impurity within us. I testify that as you continue in the path of spiritual rebirth, the atoning grace of Jesus Christ will take away your sins and the stain of those sins in you, temptations will lose their appeal, and through Christ you will become holy, as He and our Father are holy" ("Born Again," Ensign or Liahona, May 2008, 78).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Look for good examples in the scriptures.</b>As you read King Benjamin's address to his people, look for lessons in his example that can help you become a better teacher. For instance, what did King Benjamin do to find out if his people understood what he was teaching?</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Periodically it may be helpful to discuss as a class the blessings that class members are receiving as they strive to make their homes the center of their gospel learning. What verses from Mosiah 7–10 did class members ponder or discuss in their homes during the week? How did this affect their lives?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MOSIAH 7:14–33</heading>
<heading>If we turn to the Lord, trust Him, and serve Him, He will deliver us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As class members studied Mosiah 7:14–33, the experiences of Limhi's people may have inspired them to repent and turn to the Lord for deliverance. To inspire a discussion, you could invite a class member to come to class prepared to summarize how Limhi's people fell into bondage. A few others could share what they learned from Limhi about having faith and hope in the Savior. What can we learn from Limhi's reminders of how God has delivered His people? (see verses 19–20). You might ask class members to share scriptural accounts or personal experiences that have inspired them to trust God.</li>
<li>Members of your class have opportunities to inspire others to turn to God when they are in the bondage of sin or suffering from other afflictions. Perhaps it would help them to study how Limhi inspired his people. They could first read the description in Mosiah 7:20–25 of the bondage of Limhi's people and think of someone they know who is facing the bondage of sin. Then they could identify the truths that Limhi taught in Mosiah 7:18–20, 33 to help his people. How can we follow Limhi's example as we encourage our loved ones to trust God?</li>
<li>To help class members better understand the help God gives us in adversity, you could sing together and discuss the hymn "Redeemer of Israel" (Hymns, no. 6) or another song that describes how the Savior delivers us. What do Mosiah 7:17–20; Ether 12:27; and 2 Corinthians 12:7–10 add to our understanding? Perhaps class members could share experiences in which they were delivered by the Lord, even in small ways, because they showed faith in Him.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 7:26–27</heading>
<heading>Man is created in God's image.</heading>
<ul>
<li>In these verses, Limhi explained some of the truths taught by Abinadi that were hard for the people to accept. What truths can class members identify in these verses? How do these truths affect the way we see God and ourselves?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 8:12–19</heading>
<heading>The Lord provides prophets, seers, and revelators to benefit mankind.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Ammon had an opportunity to explain to Limhi the role of a seer and to testify of the importance of prophets, seers, and revelators. You may want to clarify that in our day, the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are sustained as prophets, seers, and revelators. How can we, like Ammon, speak boldly about the need for prophets, seers, and revelators? (see Mosiah 8:13–18). Perhaps class members could plan a social media post that would help others understand the role of a prophet, seer, and revelator in our day. What did we hear in the most recent general conference that we could share with our friends, family members, and neighbors to teach them about the need for prophets?</li>
<li>As a result of reading Mosiah 8:12–19, you or other class members may want to express your testimony of prophets, as Ammon did, or your gratitude for revelation through prophets, as Limhi did (see Mosiah 8:19).</li>
<li>The Prophet Joseph Smith is the seer who stands at the head of this dispensation (see D&amp;C 21:1). You may want to ask class members to share what they learn from Ammon's description of a seer (see Mosiah 8:13–18). Then they could discuss ways in which Joseph Smith was a seer. (D&amp;C 135:3 and Moses 6:36 could be helpful in this discussion.)</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 9:14–19; 10:6–10</heading>
<heading>We can face our challenges "in the strength of the Lord."</heading>
<ul>
<li>The phrase "in the strength of the Lord" appears twice in Zeniff's record of his people and their battles with the Lamanites — in Mosiah 9:14–19 and 10:6–10. Perhaps class members could search these verses and share what they feel this phrase means. How do we access "the strength of the Lord"? Encourage class members to share experiences in which they successfully faced challenges in the strength of the Lord.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 10:11–17</heading>
<heading>Our choices can influence generations.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You might invite class members to silently read Mosiah 10:11–17 and look for ways the Lamanites were affected by the choices and beliefs of their ancestors. What does this suggest about the effects our choices may have on others? How would we want ourselves and our families to be described in a generation or two? Maybe class members could write down some of the things they would want to be included in such a description.</li>
<li>A simple object lesson — such as a line of dominoes — might help illustrate the effects that people's choices can have on their posterity. Then you could invite class members to read Mosiah 10:11–17 and discuss how the beliefs and attitudes of the Lamanites were profoundly affected by choices their ancestors made centuries earlier. Elder Donald L. Hallstrom's story, found in "Additional Resources," is another example you could share. Perhaps class members could think of stories from their lives or their family history about one righteous person influencing generations for good.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>This week class members learned about the negative effect the Lamanites' choices had on their children. Let class members know that in Mosiah 11–17 they will read about an individual whose righteousness changed the lives of many.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Our decisions can affect generations.</heading>
<p>Elder Donald L. Hallstrom shared how the faithfulness of his grandparents blessed future generations:
"My paternal grandparents had two children, a son (my father) and a daughter. . . . [Their daughter] married in 1946 and four years later was expecting a child. There is something very special for parents to anticipate a daughter (in this instance an only daughter) giving birth for the first time. No one knew that she was carrying twins. Sadly, she and the twins all died during childbirth.
"My grandparents were heartbroken. Their grief, however, immediately turned them to the Lord and His Atonement. Without dwelling on why this could happen and who might be to blame, they focused on living a righteous life. My grandparents never had wealth; they were never among the socially elite; they never held high position in the Church — they were simply devoted Latter-day Saints. . . . 
"The faithfulness of Grandpa Art and Grandma Lou, especially when faced with difficulty, has now influenced four generations that have followed. Directly and profoundly, it affected their son (my father) and my mother when my parents' own daughter, their youngest child, died due to complications caused by giving birth. At 34 years of age, she passed away 10 days after childbirth, leaving 4 children, 10 days to 8 years old. With the example that they had seen in the previous generation, my parents — without hesitation — turned to the Lord for solace" ("Turn to the Lord," Ensign or Liahona, May 2010, 78–79).</p>

<p><b>Listen.</b>"Listening is an act of love. . . . Ask Heavenly Father to help you understand what your class members say.

<heading>We can stand for truth, even when we stand alone.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Although it is unlikely that members of your class will be threatened with death for their testimonies, they may face opposition for their beliefs. Perhaps they could find events or passages in Mosiah 11–13 and 17 that give them added courage to stand for truth. What gave Abinadi and Alma courage to be bold? How can we be more firm and steadfast in defending truth? The quotations in "Additional Resources" may provide some ideas.</li>
<li>To help your class learn from other examples of courageously defending truth, you could write<i>People Who Stood for Truth</i>on the board. You might start with discussing Abinadi, inviting class members to share some things that impressed them about Abinadi as they read about him this week. Then they could name other men and women — from the scriptures, their families, or personal experiences — who they feel are examples of standing for truth. What do we feel inspired to do because of these examples?</li>

<heading>MOSIAH 12:19–37</heading>
<heading>When we study God's word, we need to apply our hearts to understanding.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As they studied Mosiah 12:19–37 this week, class members may have had insights about what it means to apply our hearts to understanding God's word. Consider asking a few of them to share their thoughts. Or maybe you could use some time in class to search these verses together and discuss what they suggest about how to make gospel study more meaningful. For example, why is it important to both understand God's law and "keep it"? (Mosiah 12:29).</li>
<li>What can members of your class learn by contrasting the attitudes and practices of Noah's priests with the approach we should take to our gospel study? Invite them to read Mosiah 12:19–37, looking for the criticisms that Abinadi raised about Noah's priests. What might Abinadi say about our gospel study today? Ask class members to share what they do that helps them apply their hearts to understanding and add greater meaning to their gospel learning.</li>

<graphics-caption>Effective gospel study involves applying our hearts to understanding.</graphics-caption>
<heading>MOSIAH 13:28–15:11</heading>
<heading>Salvation comes through Jesus Christ and His Atonement.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To convince a skeptical audience about the coming of the Messiah, Abinadi quoted a moving prophecy from Isaiah (see Mosiah 14). There are several ways class members might review this chapter. They could read a few verses at a time and discuss them, or you could divide the class into small discussion groups to talk about meaningful verses, including footnotes, to discover additional insights. Encourage them to share what they learn about the Savior from this chapter.</li>
<li>Do members of your class understand what it means that Jesus Christ "satisfied the demands of justice"? (Mosiah 15:9). To help them gain a better understanding, you might start by reading together "Justice" and "Merciful, Mercy" in Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org) or "Justice" and "Mercy" at topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Perhaps someone could volunteer to write a brief definition of each term on the board. Then you could read Mosiah 15:1–9 together. How did Jesus Christ satisfy the demands of justice? How does He extend His mercy to us? The videos suggested in "Additional Resources" use stories and analogies to describe the Savior's mercy; watching one of these videos might help class members think of other analogies that illustrate how Jesus Christ satisfied the demands of justice.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 11; 12:33–37; 13:11–26</heading>
<heading>The commandments should be written in our hearts.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You might help class members understand the importance of having the commandments "written in [our] hearts" by asking them what they think this phrase means. Then invite them to contrast the commandments Abinadi taught in Mosiah 12:33–37 and 13:11–26 with the sins King Noah and his people were committing (see Mosiah 11:1–7, 14–15). How does having the commandments "written in [our] hearts" differ from merely being familiar with them? (Mosiah 13:11). How do we know if the commandments are written in our hearts? What examples can we share?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Have class members ever felt like Abinadi might have felt — that their efforts to share the gospel were in vain? Tell them that in Mosiah 18–26 they will read about the abundant fruit of Abinadi's efforts.</p>

<heading>Prophetic teachings about standing for truth.</heading>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson taught: "True disciples of Jesus Christ are willing to stand out, speak up, and be different from the people of the world. . . . There is nothing easy or automatic about becoming such powerful disciples. Our focus must be riveted on the Savior and His gospel. It is mentally rigorous to strive to look unto Him in<i>every</i>thought. But when we do, our doubts and fears flee" ("Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 40–41).</p>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson said: "May we ever be courageous and prepared to stand for what we believe, and if we must stand alone in the process, may we do so courageously, strengthened by the knowledge that in reality we are never alone when we stand with our Father in Heaven" ("Dare to Stand Alone," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 67).</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley taught: "Paul wrote to Timothy: «God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord» (2 Tim. 1:7–8). I wish that every member of this church would put those words where he might see them every morning as he begins his day. They would give us the courage to speak up, they would give us the faith to try, they would strengthen our conviction of the Lord Jesus Christ" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Gordon B. Hinckley [2016], 338).</p>

<heading>Baptism includes a covenant to serve God and stand as a witness of Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As you read Mosiah 18 and prepare to teach, you may feel inspired to help your class members review and ponder their baptismal covenant. Here's one way you could do this: Invite class members to work together to list on the board as many phrases as they can remember related to Alma's description of the baptismal covenant. When they are finished, class members could read Mosiah 18:8–10 and add anything to the lists that may be missing. (They may also add phrases from D&amp;C 20:37, 77, and 79.) It may be helpful to ask them what each phrase means and what they can do to keep that part of the baptismal covenant. How does the Lord bless us as we strive to keep our part of the covenant?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>When we are baptized, we covenant to serve God and others.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>As Alma's followers prepared to be baptized, Alma taught them that coming "into the fold of God" required making a covenant to follow God and care for His children (see Mosiah 18:8–9). Perhaps class members could share experiences when they or someone they know was strengthened by someone else fulfilling the baptismal covenant described in Mosiah 18:8–10. For example, when has someone comforted them or helped them bear their burdens? How have these experiences inspired us to keep our covenant? You might also remind class members about how Abinadi stood "as [a witness] of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (verse 9). What can we learn from his example as we seek to fulfill this part of our baptismal covenant?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 18:17–31</heading>
<heading>God's people are united.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Mosiah 18:17–31 describes the commandments Alma gave his people to help them become united as members of Christ's Church. To help class members think about how these commandments apply to them, you could ask them to search these verses in small groups and make a list of the commandments they find. How could following these commandments help ward members feel more united? Are there any goals that your class members could make individually or as a group to follow the example of Alma's people?</li>
<li>Some people wonder, why do we need a church? To help class members respond to this question, you could draw an outline of a Church building on the board and write this question under it. Class members could then search Mosiah 18:17–31 and write on the board possible answers they find in these verses. They can also find answers in the excerpt from Elder Christofferson's talk in "Additional Resources." Perhaps you could let a few class members role-play how they would respond to a friend who doesn't believe an organized church is necessary. Why are we grateful to belong to the Church?</li>
<li>While we would like to think that everyone feels welcome at church, unfortunately, not everyone does. What do we learn from the people of Alma in Mosiah 18:17–31 that can help us create a place where all feel that they belong?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 21–24</heading>
<heading>The Lord can make our burdens light.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The burdens your class members carry are different from those borne by Limhi's people or Alma's people while in captivity. But the messages of these accounts apply to anyone who feels overwhelmed by adversity or difficult circumstances. Invite class members to share what they learn from Mosiah 21–24 about how God can help us in the midst of our trials. (For a brief summary of these accounts, see L. Tom Perry, "The Power of Deliverance," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 94–97.) Class members could also share times when they, like Alma's people, experienced the fulfillment of God's promise that He would ease their burdens and visit them in their afflictions (see Mosiah 24:14).</li>
<li>It might be meaningful for class members to spend a few minutes writing down personal challenges they have faced and pondering ways the Lord helps them carry their burdens. Are there passages from Mosiah 21–24 that inspire them to turn to the Lord during adversity? How does the Lord's promise to Alma's people in Mosiah 24:14 relate to the covenant we make with the Lord at baptism? (see Mosiah 18:8–10).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Mosiah 25–28, ask them to think about someone they know who has strayed from the gospel. Tell them that as they read these chapters, they might find insights on how to help that person return.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Why do we need the Church?</heading>
<p note="list in here doesn't currently have unordered list tags">Elder D. Todd Christofferson said: "I realize that there are those who consider themselves religious or spiritual and yet reject participation in a church or even the need for such an institution. Religious practice is for them purely personal. Yet the Church is the creation of Him in whom our spirituality is centered — Jesus Christ. It is worth pausing to consider why He chooses to use a church, His Church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to carry out His and His Father's work."
Elder Christofferson then shared reasons the Lord has organized a Church (see "Why the Church," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 108–11):
"To preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ and administer the ordinances of salvation — in other words, to bring people to Christ."
"To create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the «strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life» [2 Nephi 31:18]. . . . Joined in faith, we teach and edify one another and strive to approach the full measure of discipleship."
To "offer a weekly gathering of respite and renewal, a time and place to leave the world behind — the Sabbath."
"To achieve needful things that cannot be accomplished by individuals or smaller groups [including] dealing with poverty, . . . [taking] the gospel to all the world. . . [building and operating] temples, houses of the Lord, where vital ordinances and covenants may be administered."
To make available priesthood keys, with which "the Church's priesthood officers preserve the purity of the Savior's doctrine and the integrity of His saving ordinances, . . . help prepare those who wish to receive them, judge the qualification and worthiness of those who apply, and then perform them . . . . [and] identify both truth and falsehood."</p>

<p>The best way to prepare to teach about Mosiah 25–28 is to read these chapters and live by the principles they teach. As you do, the Spirit can inspire you to teach what will be most important for your class members.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Some class members may be struggling to have consistent personal and family scripture study. Would the experiences of other class members help? Perhaps you could begin your class by inviting class members to share something they did in their personal or family study that worked well.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MOSIAH 26:15–31; 27:23–37</heading>
<heading>God freely forgives those who repent.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Repentance and forgiveness are recurring themes in these chapters. You could explore these themes by writing<i>Repentance</i>and<i>Forgiveness</i>on the board and asking class members to list under those headings what comes to mind when they think of these words. Then they could search Mosiah 26:22–24, 29–31; and 27:23–37 for words and phrases that teach them about repentance and forgiveness. Class members could add these words and phrases to the lists on the board. How does God feel about those who repent and seek forgiveness?</li>
<li>Some people may wonder if their repentance has been sufficient for God to forgive them. To help any in your class who might feel that way, you could invite class members to imagine that they are Alma the Elder and that a member of the Church in Zarahemla has asked them how to obtain forgiveness of his or her sins (maybe you could role-play this scenario). What did Alma learn from the Lord in Mosiah 26:15–31 that could help this Church member? (see also Moroni 6:8; D&amp;C 58:42–43). This statement from President Henry B. Eyring could also help: "If you have felt the influence of the Holy Ghost today, you may take it as evidence that the Atonement is working in your life" ("Gifts of the Spirit for Hard Times," Ensign, June 2007, 23).</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 27:8–24</heading>
<heading>God hears our prayers and will answer them according to His will.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many of us can relate to the feelings of Alma the Elder, whose son was "rebelling against God" (Mosiah 27:11). Perhaps class members could discuss how they might use the account in Mosiah 27:8–24 to give hope to someone who has a wayward family member. Understanding that we cannot demand a miracle or override someone's agency, what can we appropriately pray for when a loved one goes astray? (see also Alma 6:6).</li>
</ul>
<heading>MOSIAH 27:8–28:4</heading>
<heading>All men and women must be born again.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Here are some questions that could help class members learn about being born again: What does it mean to be spiritually reborn? (see Bible Dictionary, "Conversion"). How do we strive to act toward others when we are spiritually reborn? To help class members answer these questions, you could invite them to search Mosiah 27:22–28:4 for signs that Alma and the sons of Mosiah had been spiritually reborn.</li>
<li>Everyone has a conversion story, for as Alma said, "<i>all</i>mankind. . . must be born again" (Mosiah 27:25; italics added). Maybe a few class members could share how they became converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ — whether through powerful spiritual events in their lives or through a gradual, sometimes imperceptible process that might be recognized only in hindsight. You could also give class members time in class to record their experiences. (If there isn't time to do this in class, you could suggest that they do it at home.) To emphasize that our conversion should be ongoing, you might suggest that class members periodically review what they wrote and add new experiences.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>His Father Rejoiced, by Walter Rane</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Alma and others throughout the scriptures have used the metaphor of being born again to describe the change that the gospel of Jesus Christ brings to our lives. Elder David A. Bednar compared this change to a cucumber becoming a pickle (see "Additional Resources"). To help class members ponder what these comparisons teach about conversion, you could bring a cucumber and a pickle to class. Or you could invite someone to bring a baby and discuss why birth is a good analogy for what happened to Alma and the sons of Mosiah. (See Mosiah 27:23–28:7.)</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Mosiah 29–Alma 4 next week, you might mention to them that in these chapters, the people of Nephi were given a voice in their government. What can we learn from their experiences as we try to influence our communities for good?</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>A lifelong process.</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught: "Being born again, unlike our physical birth, is more a process than an event. And engaging in that process is the central purpose of mortality" ("Born Again," Ensign or Liahona, May 2008, 78).</p>
<heading>Conversion and pickles.</heading>
<p>Elder David A. Bednar shared the following analogy comparing spiritual rebirth to pickling cucumbers:
"A pickle is a cucumber that has been transformed according to a specific recipe and series of steps. The first steps in the process of changing a cucumber into a pickle are<i>preparing</i>and<i>cleaning</i>. . . .
"The next steps in this process of change are<i>immersing</i>and<i>saturating</i>the cucumbers in salt brine for an extended period of time. . . . Cucumbers can only become pickles if they are totally and completely immersed in the brine for the prescribed time period. The curing process gradually alters the composition of the cucumber and produces the transparent appearance and distinctive taste of a pickle. An occasional sprinkle of or dip in the brine cannot produce the necessary transformation. Rather, steady, sustained, and complete immersion is required for the desired change to occur.
"The final step in the process requires the<i>sealing</i>of the cured pickles in jars that have been sterilized and purified. The pickles are packed in canning jars, covered with boiling hot brine, and processed in a boiling-water-bath canner. All impurities must be removed from both the pickles and the bottles so the finished product can be protected and preserved. . . .
"Just as a cucumber must be prepared and cleaned before it can be changed into a pickle, so you and I can be prepared with «the words of faith and of good doctrine» (1 Timothy 4:6) and initially cleansed through the ordinances and covenants administered by the authority of the Aaronic Priesthood. . . .
"Just as a cucumber is transformed into a pickle as it is immersed in and saturated with salt brine, so you and I are born again as we are absorbed by and in the gospel of Jesus Christ. . . . This phase of the transformation process requires time, persistence, and patience. . . . 
"The boiling-water-bath procedure enables the pickles to be both protected and preserved over a long period of time. In a similar way, we progressively become purified and sanctified as you and I are washed in the blood of the Lamb, are born again, and receive the ordinances and honor the covenants that are administered by the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood" ("Ye Must Be Born Again," Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 19–21).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Prepare with people in mind.</b>"When you prepare, let your understanding of the people you teach guide your plans. . . . Christlike teachers are not committed to a particular style or method; they are committed to helping people build faith in Jesus Christ and become more like Him" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 7).</p>

<heading type="title">"THEY WERE STEADFAST AND IMMOVABLE"</heading>
<p>In Alma's day, a gospel teacher was not considered "any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal" (Alma 1:26). As you prepare to teach, ponder how this principle applies to you and your class.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Class members may have noticed parallels between events described in Mosiah 29–Alma 4 and things that are happening in today's world or their own lives. Give them a few minutes to review the chapters to find an example. Invite them to share what they found with someone sitting nearby.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MOSIAH 29:11–27; ALMA 2:1–7</heading>
<heading>We can be a positive influence in our communities.</heading>
<ul>
<li>If class members would benefit from discussing how to influence society for good, you could invite them to think of some issues that face your community and list a few on the board (avoid detailed discussions of these issues). Class members could review Alma 2:1–7 to find what issue the Nephites were acing and what they did about it. What might have happened if "the people of the church" had not made their voices heard? What else do we learn about being good citizens from this account, from Mosiah 29:26–27, and from the story in "Additional Resources"? Class members may want to think of something they will do to influence their community for good with regard to one of the issues on the board.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 1:2–9, 26</heading>
<heading>We can recognize and reject false teachings.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The example of Gideon resisting Nehor could be inspiring to your class. Maybe you could ask someone in advance to review Gideon's history and share it with the class (see Mosiah 19:1–8; 20:15–22; 22:1–9; and Alma 1:2–9). Based on this review, class members could list some of Gideon's inspiring characteristics. For example, when Gideon heard Nehor's false teachings, Gideon withstood Nehor "with the words of God" may (verse 9). In their personal study, class members have found scriptures that refute the teachings of Nehor found in Alma 1:3–6. Invite them to share the scriptures they found. Several scriptures are also suggested in "Additional Resources." How can we be more like Gideon in our defense of the truth?</li>
<li>Nehor's false teachings, described in Alma 1:3–6, can help us recognize tactics that Satan uses to deceive us. For example, he often hides his lies within truth. Consider inviting class members to search Alma 1:3–4 and identify the lies Satan told and the truths he used to make them appealing. What are some lies mixed with truth that deceive people today? How can we help our families and loved ones distinguish between truth and error?</li>
<li>Class members could sing or read a hymn about humility, such as "Be Thou Humble" (Hymns, no. 130), and discuss how its message differs from Nehor's message in Alma 1:2–9. They could also contrast what Nehor taught about gospel teachers with what Alma and other Church leaders taught and exemplified (see Alma 1:26; 4:15–20). What was Nehor's motivation? How was it different from Alma's? Encourage class members to ponder their own motivations for serving in the Church. What does Alma 1:26 suggest about our responsibility as learners?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 1:19–30; 4:6–15</heading>
<heading>Pride can cause us to "fail in [our] progress."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Discussing Alma 1 and Alma 4 can help class members understand how pride affects both individuals and the Church. You could divide the class into two groups and ask one group to learn about the state of the Church as described in Alma 1:19–30, while the other group learns about the state of the Church a few years later, described in Alma 4:6–15. Ask each group to share what the Church and its members were like according to the verses they read. They might plan together a creative way to do this — for example, they could draw a picture or prepare a short dramatization. After the groups share with each other, ask them to discuss what they learned about the effects of pride on the Church and its members and the blessings of humility. What lessons do these accounts hold for us today?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 4:12–20</heading>
<heading>The "word of God" and "pure testimony" can change hearts.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many people can relate to what Alma felt when he was "very sorrowful" (Alma 4:15) about the wickedness and afflictions of his people. Maybe class members could think about a loved one they are worried about and keep that person in mind as they read Alma 4:12–20. After class members read, you might ask questions like these to prompt discussion of the verses: What brought joy to the people in their difficult circumstances? What does the phrase "the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him" mean to you? (Alma 4:15). What sacrifices did Alma make to help his people, and what sacrifices are we sometimes asked to make? What examples have we seen of the power of "pure testimony"? (Alma 4:19). How can we share our testimonies without lecturing or being judgmental? You might give class members time to write a message of testimony to their loved ones.</li>
<li>Perhaps class members would benefit from discussing what "pure testimony" is. The video "Apostle Testimony Montage" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) has some excellent examples. How do these testimonies, or others we have heard, "stir [us] up in remembrance of [our] duty"? (Alma 4:19). How do these testimonies help us overcome pride and contention?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>You could explain to class members that in Alma 5–7 they will read Alma's "pure testimony" and see its effects on the people (see Alma 4:19).</p>

<heading>"Make your influence felt."</heading>
<p>Soon after Sister Belle S. Spafford was called as Relief Society General President in 1945, Relief Society leaders were invited to attend a meeting of a prominent national women's council. Relief Society general leaders had been members of this council for many years, but they felt they had recently been treated poorly by the council. After discussion with her counselors, Sister Spafford recommended to President George Albert Smith, the President of the Church, that the Relief Society should terminate its membership in the council.
As they discussed the recommendation, Sister Spafford said, "You know, President Smith, we don't get anything from the Council." 
She later recounted:
"The President looked at me with surprise. He said, «Sister Spafford, do you always think in terms of what you get? Don't you think it is well at times to think in terms of what you have to give? I believe,» he continued, «that Mormon women have something to give to the women of the world, and that they may also learn from them. Rather than have you terminate your membership, I suggest that you take several of your ablest board members and go back to this meeting.»
"Then he said with emphasis, «Make your influence felt»" (Belle S. Spafford, A Woman's Reach [1974], 96–97).</p>
<p>Sister Spafford obeyed this counsel. She served for many years in the council and was eventually elected as one of its leaders.</p>

<ul>
<li>Class members were invited to reflect on the questions in Alma 5:14–33 in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. You might begin a discussion on these verses by asking class members to share what questions from these verses were meaningful to them. You could then invite class members to work in groups to review Alma 5:14–33 and discover what it means to experience a change of heart through the Savior and His Atonement. They could also look for the blessings that come from a changed heart. What other metaphors have been used to describe the change Alma describes? (For example, see John 3:1–7; 2 Corinthians 5:17; Dale G. Renlund, "Preserving the Heart's Mighty Change," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 97–99.)

<heading>ALMA 5:44–51</heading>
<heading>We can gain our own witness of the Savior and His gospel through the Holy Ghost.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Like Alma, members of your class have gained their own testimonies of the Savior and His gospel. To help them learn what Alma did to receive his witness through the Spirit, you could pass out pieces of paper with the word<i>Testimony</i>written at the top. Class members could work in pairs to review Alma 5:44–51 and use what they learn in these verses to write a "recipe" for a testimony. For example, the "ingredients" of the recipe could be truths that make up our testimonies. The "instructions" for the recipe could be things we need to do to gain a testimony. (See the message from Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf in "Additional Resources" for some ideas.) What "ingredients" and "instructions" could they add to their recipe from their own experiences or other experiences in the scriptures? Invite the pairs to share what they learned and what they are doing to invite the Holy Ghost to testify of truth to them.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 6</heading>
<heading>We gather as Saints to hear God's word and do His work.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To remind class members about the importance of gathering together as a body of Saints, you could invite them to imagine that someone they know feels that belonging to a church is not necessary. What could they share from Alma 6 to teach this person about some of the blessings of belonging to a church? How can we better accomplish the purposes of gathering that Alma described?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 7:7–16</heading>
<heading>The Savior took upon Himself our sins, pains, and afflictions.</heading>
<ul>
<li>There may be people in your class who urgently need to know what Alma 7:7–16 teaches — that the Savior took upon Himself not just our sins but also our pains, afflictions, sicknesses, and infirmities. How will you help them discover this? Perhaps you could make a chart on the board with the headings<i>What the Savior suffered</i>and<i>Why He suffered.</i>The class could complete the chart after reading Alma 7:7–16. It may also help to consider other things the Savior suffered during His life (see examples in "Additional Resources").</li>
<li>After discussing what Alma taught in Alma 7:7–16, perhaps class members could share experiences when the Savior succored them, which means that He helped them (see "Additional Resources" for examples of ways Jesus succors us). You could also share the following quotation from President Dallin H. Oaks: "Our Savior has revealed that He «descended below all things» (D&amp;C 88:6). . . . We might even say that having descended beneath it all, He is perfectly positioned to lift us and give us the strength we need to endure our afflictions. We have only to ask" ("Strengthened by the Atonement of Jesus Christ," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 64).</li>
<li>Alma declared that the coming of the Redeemer "is of more importance than" anything else. Perhaps class members could imagine that they are in a history class discussing history's most important events. What verses from Alma 7 would they share to support Alma's claim in verse 7? What counsel did Alma give his people that can help us prepare for the Savior's coming?</li>

<heading>Gaining our own testimonies.</heading>
<p>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf gave the following scriptural pattern for "receiving a personal testimony rooted in the witness of the Holy Ghost":
"First: Desire to believe. The Book of Mormon encourages us: «If [you] will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, . . . even if [you] can no more than desire to believe» (Alma 32:27). . . . God promises us divine help even if we have only a desire to believe, but it has to be a true and not a pretended desire.
"Second: Search the scriptures. Have questions; study them out; search in the scriptures for answers. Again, the Book of Mormon has good advice for us: «If [you] give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart» through diligent study of the word of God, the good seed «will begin to swell within your breasts» if you will not resist with unbelief. This good seed will «enlarge [your] soul» and «enlighten [your] understanding» (Alma 32:28).
"Third: Do the will of God; keep the commandments. . . . We need to come to Christ and follow His teachings. The Savior taught: «My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. If any man<i>will do his will</i>, he shall know of the doctrine» [John 7:16–17; italics added]. . . .
"Fourth: Ponder, fast, and pray. To receive knowledge from the Holy Ghost, we must ask Heavenly Father for it [see Alma 5:45–46; Moroni 10:3–4]" ("The Power of a Personal Testimony," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2006, 38–39).</p>

<heading type="ref">Alma 8–12</heading>
<heading type="title">JESUS CHRIST WILL COME TO REDEEM HIS PEOPLE</heading>
<p>Begin your preparation to teach by studying Alma 8–12. Then review this outline for additional ideas that will encourage class members to share what they learned in their study.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Give class members a few minutes to reflect on their personal or family scripture study this week. How has their study influenced the choices they made during the week? Invite a few class members to share their thoughts.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 8</heading>
<heading>Our efforts to share the gospel may require persistence and patience.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many people find it difficult to share the gospel — especially when they have felt rejected, as Alma was. Alma's example could help them trust God and find courage to continue sharing their testimonies with others. Consider these discussion questions: What do we learn from the angel's message to Alma in Alma 8:15? What about Alma's reaction to the message, found in Alma 8:14–32, inspires us to keep sharing the gospel when we experience rejection? What advice would we give to someone who tried to share the gospel but was rejected? Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's counsel in "Additional Resources" might help with this conversation.</li>
<li>The story of Alma and Amulek demonstrates how important members' efforts are to missionary work. What do class members learn from Alma 8:19–30 about the relationship between local members and full-time missionaries? (see also Alma 10:1–12).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 9:18–30</heading>
<heading>God judges His children according to the light and knowledge they have.</heading>
<ul>
<li>There is a serious warning in these verses to all Church members — once we have received light and knowledge, we are expected to treasure it, nourish it, live it, and use it to bless others. To help class members examine this expectation, you could ask them to read Alma's teachings in Alma 9:18–30 and share messages they find about the responsibility they have because of what they know. Why might there be greater condemnation when we sin against greater light? Provide time for class members to ponder what they can do to be more true to the light and knowledge they have received. You might suggest that they read Doctrine and Covenants 50:24 while they ponder.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 11–12</heading>
<heading>God's plan is a plan of redemption.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You could begin a discussion of this doctrine by inviting a class member to draw a diagram of the plan of redemption on the board. Then you could divide sections of Alma 11–12 among class members and invite them to look for truths that they would add to the diagram. For example, what does God's plan redeem us from? (see Alma 11:38–45). How does knowing these truths about the plan of redemption bless our lives?</li>
<li>To help class members share what Alma 11–12 teaches them about the plan of redemption, you could write the following headings on the board:<i>The Fall, The Redeemer, Repentance, Death, Resurrection,</i>and<i>Judgment</i>. Class members could choose one of these topics and search Alma 11–12 for truths they learn about it. Invite class members to write the truths they find, along with a scripture reference, under the appropriate heading on the board. As a class, discuss how knowing these truths influences our lives and the decisions we make.</li>
<li>Your class members may benefit from a discussion centered on Alma 12:31–32, where Alma taught that after the Fall, God gave Adam and Eve commandments — but only after teaching them His plan. How does knowing about the plan affect the way we see or feel about the commandments? Maybe you could talk about some specific commandments; for example, how does knowing about God's plan help us keep the Sabbath day holy or obey the law of chastity?</li>
<li>Some class members might have questions about Alma 11:26–39, where Amulek said there is only one God. The following scriptures clarify how the members of the Godhead are "one God" while still being separate beings: John 17:20–23; 2 Nephi 31:21; and 3 Nephi 19:29. This statement from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland might also help: "We believe They are one in every significant and eternal aspect imaginable<i>except</i>believing them to be three persons combined in one substance" ("The Only True God and Jesus Christ Whom Thou Hast Sent," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 40).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 12:9–14</heading>
<heading>If we will not harden our hearts, we can receive more of the word of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One of the messages Alma and Amulek taught several times was how the condition of our hearts influences how much truth we can receive from the Lord. To help class members discover the truth of this principle, you could invite them to read Alma 12:9–14 in pairs or small groups and discuss the results of having a hard heart. (You could also ask them to read Alma 8:9–11; 9:5, 30–31; and 10:6, 25.) What does it mean to have a soft heart? (see Jeremiah 24:7; Alma 16:16; Helaman 3:35). How does a soft heart help us better understand God's word?</li>
<li>Alma taught that when we harden our hearts, we receive "the lesser portion" of God's word (Alma 12:10). Perhaps class members could share experiences from the scriptures that illustrate this principle. How does the Lord soften our hearts so that we can continue to learn more from Him? What personal experiences can we share?</li>
<li>To help class members understand what it means to have a soft heart, you could share some of the examples listed in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Alma 13–16 this week, you could tell them that they will find out how Alma's words were fulfilled in the lives of Zeezrom and the people of Ammonihah.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Take a courageous stand.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland gave the following encouragement to those who are mistreated for sharing or defending the gospel:
"If you haven't already, you will one day find yourself called upon to defend your faith or perhaps even endure some personal abuse simply because you are a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Such moments will require both courage and courtesy on your part.
". . . You may wonder if it is worth it to take a courageous moral stand in high school or to go on a mission only to have your most cherished beliefs reviled or to strive against much in society that sometimes ridicules a life of religious devotion. Yes, it is worth it. . . . 
"Friends, especially my young friends, take heart. Pure Christlike love flowing from true righteousness can change the world. . . .
"Be strong. Live the gospel faithfully even if others around you I don't live it at all. Defend your beliefs with courtesy and with compassion, but defend them" ("The Cost — and Blessings — of Discipleship," Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 6–9).</p>
<heading>Their hearts were softened.</heading>
<p>The following general conference addresses give examples of people whose hearts were softened by the Lord:</p>
<ul>
<li>The story of the Hatfield family in President Russell M. Nelson's message "The Price of Priesthood Power," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016,66–67.</li>
<li>The story of Harold Gallacher in President Thomas S. Monson's message "The Sacred Call of Service," Ensign or Liahona, May 2005, 55.</li>
<li>The story of David in President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's message "Learn from Alma and Amulek," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 73–74.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Look through God's eyes.</b>Strive to see your class members as God sees them, and the Spirit will show you their divine worth and potential. As you do this, you will be guided in your efforts to help them (see Teaching in the Savior's Way, 6).</p>

<heading type="title">"ENTER INTO THE REST OF THE LORD"</heading>
<p>Lasting conversion requires more than an inspiring Sunday School lesson once a week. Encourage class members to seek personal spiritual experiences throughout the week.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>What might prompt class members to share with each other their experiences with learning and living the gospel? Maybe you could invite them to share an insight they found in Alma 13–16 that surprised them or that they hadn't thought of before. As they share, ask them how they feel this new insight will make a difference in their lives.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 13:1–19</heading>
<heading>Priesthood ordinances help God's children receive redemption through Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some members of your class may have found something that deepened their appreciation for the priesthood as they studied Alma 13. Invite them to share what they found. You could also read together verses 2 and 16 and ask a question like "How do the priesthood and its ordinances help you 'look forward to [God's] Son for redemption'?" If it's helpful, a list of ordinances can be found in True to the Faith, 109–10.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Priesthood ordinances help us look to Jesus Christ for redemption.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Many people in Ammonihah were followers of Nehor, who taught false ideas about the role of priests. To help class members learn about the true nature of the priesthood, you could ask them to contrast Nehor's view of what priests should do (see Alma 1:3–6) with what Alma taught (see Alma 13:1–12). In what ways are Nehor's teachings similar to the world's views about power and leadership? How are Alma's teachings different?</li>
<li>Reading Alma 13:1–19 might lead to a discussion about being "prepared from the foundation of the world" for our responsibilities in the Lord's work. What does Alma 13:3 suggest about the way we should view or approach these responsibilities? (see also D&amp;C 138:56).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 13</heading>
<heading>The Lord invites us to enter into His rest.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Alma taught that the priesthood helps us "enter into the rest of the Lord" (Alma 13:16). To start a discussion about this idea, you could ask class members to read Alma 13:6, 12–13, 16, and 29 and share what these verses teach about "the rest of the Lord." They could also identify the characteristics of people who "enter into the rest of the Lord." What can we do to experience the rest of the Lord during our mortal lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 14</heading>
<heading>In times of trial and tragedy, we must trust the Lord.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Alma 14 could be an opportunity to discuss how we can respond faithfully when we or our loved ones face persecution or trials even when we're trying to be righteous. You might begin by inviting class members to imagine that they are journalists reporting on an event in Alma 14. What kinds of questions might they ask Alma or Amulek about the event? For example, "Why did the Lord allow you and other righteous people to suffer?" or "What advice do you have for those who are experiencing difficult trials?" Based on what we know from Alma 14, how might Alma or Amulek answer these questions?</li>
<li>Most of us can relate somewhat to the way Amulek felt when he witnessed the suffering of the faithful people of Ammonihah: we "also [are] pained" (Alma 14:10), and we wish we could do something about it. What do we learn from what Alma said in this situation? (see Alma 14:8–13). You could share the statement from President Spencer W. Kimball in "Additional Resources." Perhaps class members could summarize the main message of President Kimball's statement in their own words.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 15:16, 18</heading>
<heading>Discipleship requires sacrifice.</heading>
<ul>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests listing what Amulek gave up and what he gained when he embraced the gospel. Maybe class members would be willing to share the lists they created, or they could make these lists in class. These scriptures can help: Alma 10:4–5; 15:16, 18; 16:13–15; and 34:8. Why was Amulek willing to make such sacrifices? Why are we willing to do so? How can we follow the example of Alma, who "strengthened [Amulek] in the Lord"?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 16:1–10</heading>
<heading>The words of the prophets will be fulfilled.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Alma 16 gives examples of someone who trusted a prophet and people who did not. To help class members learn from these examples, you could write on the board two headings:<i>Zoram</i>and<i>People of Ammonihah</i>. Class members could read Alma 16:1–10 and write under each heading words and phrases that describe the attitude these people had toward the words of the prophet Alma. What are we doing to show Heavenly Father that we have faith in the words of the living prophets?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Consider asking class members if they've ever wished they could be better at sharing the gospel. Reading Alma 17–22 can inspire them with ideas to help them accomplish this goal.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>God does not always prevent tragedy.</heading>
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball once commented on the many seemingly inexplicable tragedies that happen in the world:
"Could the Lord have prevented these tragedies? The answer is, Yes. The Lord is omnipotent, with all power to control our lives, save us pain, prevent all accidents,. . . even [protect us] from death, if he will. But he will not. . . .
"If all the sick for whom we pray were healed, if all the righteous were protected and the wicked destroyed, the whole program of the Father would be annulled and the basic principle of the gospel, free agency, would be ended. No man would have to live by faith. . . . 
". . . If we were to close the doors upon sorrow and distress, we might be excluding our greatest friends and benefactors. Suffering can make saints of people as they learn patience, long-suffering, and self-mastery. . . .
". . . I am grateful that even through the priesthood I cannot heal all the sick. I might heal people who should die. I might relieve people of suffering who should suffer. I fear I would frustrate the purposes of God.
"Had I limitless power, and yet limited vision and understanding, I might have saved Abinadi from the flames of fire when he was burned at the stake, and in doing so I might have irreparably damaged him. He died a martyr and went to a martyr's reward — exaltation. 
"I would likely have protected Paul against his woes if my power were boundless. I would surely have healed his «thorn in the flesh.» [2 Corinthians 12:7.] And in so doing I might have foiled the Lord's program. . .
"I fear that had I been in Carthage Jail on June 27, 1844, I might have deflected the bullets that pierced the body of the Prophet [Joseph Smith] and the Patriarch [Hyrum Smith]. I might have saved them from the sufferings and agony, but lost them to the martyr's death and reward. . .
"With such uncontrolled power, I surely would have felt to protect Christ from the agony in Gethsemane, the insults, the thorny crown, the indignities in the court, the physical injuries. I would have administered to his wounds and healed them, giving him cooling water instead of vinegar. I might have saved him from suffering and death, and lost to the world his atoning sacrifice. . . . 
"In the face of apparent tragedy we must put our trust in God, knowing that despite our limited view his purposes will not fail" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 14–17, 20).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Invite diligent learning.</b>"When you prepare to teach, instead of thinking, «What will I do to teach?» ask yourself, 'What will my class members do to learn?" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 29).</p>

<p>Before you can help others discover truths in the scriptures, you need to discover truths for yourself. Read Alma 17–22 with members of your class in mind.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To give class members an opportunity to share something they learned in their personal or family study, you could invite them to pick a person described in Alma 17–22 and complete a sentence like the following: "Abish taught me __" or "Lamoni taught me __."</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 17:1–4</heading>
<heading>Our faith is strengthened as we diligently seek to know the truth.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members have probably heard multiple times the importance of simple gospel habits. Alma 17:1–4 can help them see the powerful effect these habits can have on our lives. You could ask half the class to search these verses for what the sons of Mosiah did and the other half to search for the results of what they did. What have been the results of doing these things in our lives?</li>
<li>For a deeper discussion on some of the habits that strengthened the sons of Mosiah, you could write on the board<i>Searching the Scriptures, Prayer,</i>and<i>Fasting.</i>Then class members could search for scriptures that teach about blessings that come from scripture study, prayer, and fasting (the Topical Guide or Guide to the Scriptures may be helpful). They could write on the board what they find and share with each other ideas about how to improve their scripture study, prayer, and fasting in a way that draws them closer to God.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 17–18</heading>
<heading>Our love can help others prepare to receive the gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>There are many ways to share the gospel, and all of them are more effective when love is the motivation. Perhaps class members could identify verses in Alma 17–18 that show how Ammon was motivated by love to share the gospel. What other truths about sharing the gospel do we learn from his example? Class members may be able to share experiences in which sincere love softened someone's heart and allowed him or her to be more receptive to the gospel message. The statement by President Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources" could also help members understand the importance of making sure our efforts are founded on love.</li>

<heading>ALMA 18–22</heading>
<heading>Teaching and learning gospel truths effectively can lead to a change of heart.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Once Ammon and Aaron gained the trust of King Lamoni and his father, they were able to help them understand essential gospel truths. Perhaps it would be helpful if class members made a list of the truths Ammon taught Lamoni (see Alma 18:24–39) and compared it with a list of the truths Aaron taught Lamoni's father (see Alma 22:1–16). Half of the class could work on one list while the other half works on the other list. Why might understanding these truths have led Lamoni and his father to believe and trust in Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>The accounts of Aaron and Ammon teaching King Lamoni and his father provide a great opportunity to discuss effective gospel teaching and learning. What principles of teaching do class members notice? (see, for example, Alma 18:24–28 and Alma 22:7–13). What principles of learning do they find in the examples of King Lamoni and his father? (see, for example, Alma 18:25–31; 22:17–18).</li>
<li>To learn about how the doctrine of the gospel can influence our lives, class members could search Alma 18:40–41; 20:1–15; and Alma 22:15–18, 25–27 to find out how King Lamoni and his father felt and acted after they understood gospel truths and were converted. How do these truths help us come unto Christ? What can we do to help ourselves and our loved ones understand and live these truths?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 19–22</heading>
<heading>Our testimonies can have a profound influence on others.</heading>
<ul>
<li>During their personal study of Alma 19–22, class members may have pondered the far-reaching effect that one person's testimony can have on others. Encourage them to share what they learned. What do the accounts in Alma 19–22 suggest about our personal efforts to share the gospel? President Gordon B. Hinckley's story in "Additional Resources" can help emphasize this point.</li>
<li>What are some good analogies you could share to illustrate what can happen when we share our testimonies with others? Possible examples are a pebble making ripples in a lake or yeast helping dough rise. After reviewing some examples of people sharing their testimonies in Alma 19–22, class members could share how they have been affected by the testimonies of others.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>You might ask class members if they have ever wondered how to make their conversion steady and enduring. In Alma 23–29, they will read about a group of people who accepted the gospel and "never did fall away" (Alma 23:6).</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Share the gospel out of love.</heading>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks shared a valuable lesson he learned from an experience he had as a young man:
"I was assigned to visit a less-active member, a successful professional many years older than I. Looking back on my actions, I realize that I had very little loving concern for the man I visited. I acted out of duty, with a desire to report 100 percent on my home teaching. One evening, close to the end of a month, I phoned to ask if my companion and I could come right over and visit him. His chastening reply taught me an unforgettable lesson. 
"«No, I don't believe I want you to come over this evening,» he said. «I'm tired. I've already dressed for bed. I am reading, and I am just not willing to be interrupted so that you can report 100 percent on your home teaching this month.» That reply still stings me because I knew he had sensed my selfish motivation.
"I hope no person we approach with an invitation to hear the message of the restored gospel feels that we are acting out of any reason other than a genuine love for them and an unselfish desire to share something we know to be precious" ("Sharing the Gospel," Ensign, Nov. 2001, 8).</p>
<heading>Our influence is often unknown.</heading>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley related a story in which a missionary reported to his mission president at the conclusion of his service. The missionary said:
"I haven't had any results from my work. I have wasted my time and my father's money. It's been a waste of time. . . . I baptized only one person during the two years that I have been here. That was a twelve-year-old boy up in the back hollows of Tennessee."
The mission president decided to keep track of the boy this missionary baptized. He grew up, married, and moved to Idaho. His children went on missions, and their children went on missions. The mission president traveled to Idaho and asked members of that family about their missions. He later said, "I discovered that, as the result of the baptism of that one little boy in the back hollows of Tennessee by a missionary who thought he had failed, more than 1,100 people have come into the Church" (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 360–61).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Reserve time for learners to share.</b>"When learners share what they are learning, they not only feel the Spirit and strengthen their own testimonies, but they also encourage other class members to discover truths for themselves. . . . Reserve time for student sharing in every lesson — in some cases, you may find that these discussions are the lesson" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 30).</p>

<p>As you read Alma 23–29, remember that in order to help others learn the truths in these chapters, you need to have meaningful experiences with the truths yourself.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>You could invite class members to write on the board verses that stood out to them during their personal or family study. Spend a few minutes inviting several people to discuss a truth they learned from the verses they wrote.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine ALMA 23–25; 27</heading>
<heading>Our conversion to Jesus Christ and His gospel changes our lives.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are all striving to deepen our conversion. Perhaps the story of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies can encourage those you teach in their efforts to do this. You might start by writing on the board a question like the following:<i>What does it mean to be converted?</i>or<i>What kinds of changes occur in people's lives when they are converted?</i>Class members could look for answers in these passages: Alma 23:6–7, 17–18; 24:17–19; 25:15–16; and 27:26–30. They might be able to share insights from other verses they have read in Alma 23–25 and 27. Class members may also find helpful answers to these questions in Elder David A. Bednar's message "Converted unto the Lord" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2012, 106–9; see also "Additional Resources"). What changes did the Anti-Nephi-Lehies make as a result of their conversion? How does their example inspire us to deepen our conversion to Jesus Christ and His gospel?</li>
<li>How can you inspire class members to abandon any false traditions and bury their weapons of rebellion, as the Anti-Nephi-Lehies did? Consider reviewing Alma 23:5–7 together. What are some good traditions that the gospel helps us develop? What might the Lamanites' "weapons of. . . rebellion" represent in our day? How can we "bury them up deep in the earth"? (Alma 24:17). Invite class members to ponder what false traditions or weapons of rebellion they need to leave behind so they can live the gospel more completely.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 24:7–16</heading>
<heading>Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be forgiven when we repent.</heading>
<ul>
<li>If you feel prompted to have a class discussion about repentance, the account of the Anti-Nephi-Lehies in Alma 24 is an inspiring example to use. You could assign each class member a verse to read from Alma 24:7–16 and ask them to write on the board something they learn from their verse about repentance. They could then search the following scriptures to find additional insights about repentance: Isaiah 53:5–6; 2 Nephi 2:6–8; and Mosiah 5:2.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 24:13–15; 26; 29</heading>
<heading>The gospel brings joy.</heading>
<ul>
<li>In Alma 23–29, the word "joy" appears 24 times, making these chapters a good place to learn how living the gospel — and sharing it — brings joy. You could divide class members into groups and ask each group to review some of the following verses, looking for reasons why Ammon, the sons of Mosiah, and Alma rejoiced: Alma 24:13–15; 26:12–22; and 29:1–17. Class members could list what they found on the board. What do we learn from these verses about how the gospel brings us joy?</li>
<li>President Russell M. Nelson taught: "When the focus of our lives is on God's plan of salvation and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening — or not happening — in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him. He is the source of all joy" ("Joy and Spiritual Survival," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 82). Perhaps class members could share experiences that have helped them understand the truth of President Nelson's words.</li>
<li>Alma and Ammon found great joy in sharing the gospel. You might invite class members to find verses in Alma 26 and 29 that could inspire a young person to serve a mission — or inspire anyone to share the gospel with others. Consider providing a few minutes for class members to plan something they can do to share the gospel. Invite them to act on their plans, and in a future class you can encourage them to talk about their efforts.</li>
<li>When Alma helped others repent, he was reminded of God's goodness (see Alma 29:10–13). Perhaps you could give class members a few moments to study these verses and list what Alma remembered. What reminds us of God's goodness? How have we seen God's goodness in our lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 26–27</heading>
<heading>We can be instruments in God's hands.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members explore what it means to be "instruments in the hands of God" (Alma 26:3), you might display various types of instruments or tools. You could also invite class members to bring some tools that they use. How are these instruments useful? How are we like instruments in God's work? You could invite class members to identify ways Ammon and his fellow missionaries were instruments in the hands of God (see, for example, Alma 26:1–5, 11–12). What insights do we gain from Doctrine and Covenants 4 about being instruments in His hands? Class members could also share experiences when they have felt the joy that comes from being an instrument in God's hands.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Many of the same false ideas that lead God's children astray today were also common in Alma's day. Tell class members that in Alma 30–31 they will see how Alma and others responded to these false teachings.</p>

<p>Elder David A. Bednar taught:
"The essence of the gospel of Jesus Christ entails a fundamental and permanent change in our very nature made possible through the Savior's Atonement. True conversion brings a change in one's beliefs, heart, and life to accept and conform to the will of God (see Acts 3:19; 3 Nephi 9:20) and includes a conscious commitment to become a disciple of Christ."
After quoting Alma 23:6–8, Elder Bednar went on to explain:
"Two major elements are described in these verses: (1)<i>the knowledge of the truth,</i>which may be interpreted as a testimony, and (2)<i>converted unto the Lord,</i>which I understand to be conversion to the Savior and His gospel. Thus, the powerful combination of both testimony and conversion unto the Lord produced firmness and steadfastness and provided spiritual protection.
"They never did fall away and surrendered «the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more.» To set aside cherished «weapons of rebellion» such as selfishness, pride, and disobedience requires more than merely believing and knowing. Conviction, humility, repentance, and submissiveness precede the abandonment of our weapons of rebellion. Do you and I still possess weapons of rebellion that keep us from becoming converted unto the Lord? If so, then we need to repent now.
"Note that the Lamanites were not converted to the missionaries who taught them or to the excellent programs of the Church. They were not converted to the personalities of their leaders or to preserving a cultural heritage or the traditions of their fathers. They were converted unto the Lord — to Him as the Savior and to His divinity and doctrine — and they never did fall away" ("Converted unto the Lord," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2012, 107–9).</p>

<p>After reading Alma 30–31 and seeking inspiration for your own life, listen for promptings about what messages will bless members of your class.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>If you feel that class members are hesitant to share, you might give them a few minutes to review Alma 30–31 or any notes they made in their study at home this week. Then they could share with a partner or the class one powerful message they found.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 30:6–31</heading>
<heading>The adversary tries to deceive us with false doctrine.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As you consider the needs of your class, would it help them understand the difference between gospel truths and Satan's counterfeits if you used an object lesson? If so, you could show them some fake items, such as play money or toy food, along with real money or real food. How can we tell that the fake items are not real? The class could then identify the false teachings of Korihor in Alma 30:6–31. What might be enticing about these teachings? What do gospel truths offer us that Satan's counterfeit teachings cannot offer? Invite class members to share what helped Alma discern between true doctrine and false doctrine (see Alma 30:32–54). What other ways have class members found helpful?</li>
<li>To help class members learn how to protect themselves from the effects of false doctrine, you could review the description of an anti-Christ in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. Which verses in Alma 30:6–31 show that Korihor fits this description? Which of his teachings are similar to false teachings in our day? (see Alma 30:12–18, 23–28). How can we avoid being deceived by these teachings?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 30:39–46</heading>
<heading>All things testify of God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Because we live in a world similar to Alma's, where some people teach that there is no God, Alma's testimony in Alma 30:39–44 could be helpful to members of your class. You could invite them to read these verses and make a list on the board of truths and evidences Alma gives that testify there is a God. What other testimonies do we have that God lives? As part of the discussion, consider sharing the statement by President M. Russell Ballard in "Additional Resources." You might also invite someone to come prepared to sing a hymn about the goodness of God, such as "How Great Thou Art" (Hymns, no. 86), or you could sing the hymn together.</li>
<li>As Alma talked with Korihor, he perceived that Korihor had "put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in [him]" (Alma 30:42). Consider asking class members to search Alma 30:39–46, looking for other references to the Holy Ghost. What role does the Holy Ghost play in testifying to us of the reality of God and Jesus Christ? How can we help those who have doubts or questions seek truth through the Holy Ghost?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Korihor Confronts Alma, by Robert T. Barrett</graphics-caption>
<heading>ALMA 31</heading>
<heading>God's word has the power to lead people to righteousness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Are there members of your class who could share an experience when "the virtue of the word of God" (Alma 31:5) helped them or someone they know make changes in their life? You might want to contact class members in advance so they can be prepared to share their experiences. Encourage them to share verses from Alma 31 that apply to their experiences. Other class members could also share ways in which God's word has had a "powerful effect upon [their] minds" (Alma 31:5). Members might benefit from reading other scriptures that testify about the power of God's word (see "Additional Resources" for a few examples).</li>
<li>As members of your class studied Alma 31 this week, they may have been inspired by Alma's example of praying for the Zoramites. Consider asking them what they learned from this chapter about reaching out to family members or friends who have left the gospel path or are struggling with their faith. You could also ask them to search Alma 31 together and list on the board things they notice about Alma that helped him rescue the Zoramites. How can we use the word of God more in our efforts to rescue others? (For additional insights, you could share the quotation by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland in "Additional Resources.")</li>
<li>What do class members find in Alma 31:30–38 that can help those who sorrow for the sins of others as Alma did?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Ask class members what doctrine or gospel principles they might teach to counter the falsehoods Alma discovered among the Zoramites. Tell them that as they read Alma 32–35 they'll discover how Alma used God's word to help the Zoramites see the need to change.</p>

<heading>All things denote there is a God.</heading>
<p>President M. Russell Ballard taught that the "eternal evidences" Alma gave for the existence of God "continue to testify to us today" (see Alma 30:44):
"Astronauts viewing the earth from space have stated how incredibly beautiful it is and how alive it appears. United States Senator Jake Garn wrote of his experience in space: «It is impossible for me to describe the beauty of the earth. It is a breathtaking, awe-inspiring, spiritual experience to view the earth from space while traveling at twenty-five times the speed of sound. I could also look into the blackness of the vacuum of space and see billions of stars and galaxies millions of light-years away. The universe is so vast as to be impossible to comprehend. But I did comprehend the hand of God in all things. I felt his presence throughout my seven days in space. I know that God created this earth and the universe. . . . I know that God lives and is the Creator of us all» (letter to M. Russell Ballard, 3 March 1988)" ("God's Love for His Children," Ensign, May 1988, 58).</p>
<heading>Nourishing others with God's word.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught:
"Are we really nurturing our youth and our new members in a way that will sustain them when the stresses of life appear? Or are we giving them a kind of theological Twinkie — spiritually empty calories?. . . During a severe winter several years ago, President Boyd K. Packer noted that a goodly number of deer had died of starvation while their stomachs were full of hay. In an honest effort to assist, agencies had supplied the superficial when the substantial was what had been needed. Regrettably they had<i>fed</i>the deer but they had not<i>nourished</i>them. . . .
"Satan is certainly not subtle in his teachings; why should we be? Whether we are instructing our children at home or standing before an audience in church, let us never make our faith difficult to detect. . . . Give scripturally based sermons. Teach the revealed doctrine" ("A Teacher Come from God," Ensign, May 1998, 26–27).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Help learners discover truths for themselves.</b>One of your roles as a teacher is to guide your learners to discover truths in the scriptures. They are more likely to understand and cherish principles if they find these principles for themselves rather than simply hearing a teacher talk about them.</p>

<heading type="title">"PLANT THIS WORD IN YOUR HEARTS"</heading>
<p>No matter how many times you have read Alma 32–35, read them again as you prepare to teach. Be open to new insights from the Spirit.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To help class members share what they learned from reading Alma 32–35 at home, you could give them a few minutes to review these chapters and write on the board any themes or topics they noticed. As a class, discuss why these themes or topics are meaningful.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 32:1–16</heading>
<heading>We can choose to be humble.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To lead a discussion about humility as taught in Alma 32:1–16, you could start by inviting class members to name experiences that might humble a person (Alma 32:2–5 gives one example). Some class members may be willing to share their own experiences with learning humility. How can being "brought to be humble" (Alma 32:12) be a blessing? The statements about humility in "Additional Resources" might help foster a discussion. You could also read Doctrine and Covenants 112:10 or sing a hymn about humility, such as "Be Thou Humble" (Hymns, no. 130), as a class.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 32:17–43</heading>
<heading>We exercise faith in Jesus Christ by planting and nourishing His word in our hearts.</heading>
<ul>
<li>We sometimes think of worship only as being the things we do in formal settings like a church building (see Alma 32:5, 9, 11), but Alma's definition of worship is much broader. For example, he taught that developing and exercising faith in Jesus Christ is an important form of worship that can take place outside a formal setting. To help your class understand this principle, you might draw a picture of a seed and a tree on the board and discuss questions like the following: What does the seed represent? (see Alma 32:28; 33:22–23). How can we plant the seed — or testimony of Jesus Christ and His Atonement — in our hearts and nourish it? (see Alma 32:36–43; 33). What experiences can we share in which our efforts to follow the Savior brought forth precious fruit? How do Alma's teachings influence the way we worship Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>The "experiment" that Alma described to help the Zoramites develop faith in Jesus Christ can also help us learn if other gospel principles are true. To help the class understand Alma's experiment, you could talk about what an experiment is. There may be someone in the class who has done an experiment before and could help with this explanation. What is the purpose of an experiment? How is an experiment similar to what Alma invited the people to do in Alma 32:26–36? Perhaps class members could share various ways in which they have "experimented" upon the word of God. How have they come to know that "the word [of God] is good"? (Alma 32:28).</li>
<li>What might Alma say to someone who wants to gain or strengthen a testimony of Jesus Christ? To explore this question, you could divide the class into two groups. One group could read Alma 32:26–36 to determine what Alma might say to someone who is trying to gain a testimony, and the other group could read Alma 32:36–43 to determine what he might say to someone whose testimony has weakened. Then one person from each group could take turns representing Alma and role-playing how to help someone gain or strengthen a testimony.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 33:2–11; 34:17–29</heading>
<heading>We can worship God in prayer, anytime and anywhere.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You might help the class contrast Alma and Amulek's teachings about prayer and worship with the Zoramites' false ideas. Class members could review Alma 31:13–23 and list on the board what the Zoramites believed about prayer and worship. Then they could look for truths in Alma 33:2–11 and 34:17–29 that contrast with these beliefs. What do these verses teach us about how we might improve our prayers and our worship?</li>
<li>You could encourage a discussion about prayer by writing words like<i>Who? What? When? Where? Why?</i>and<i>How?</i>on the board. Class members could search Alma 33:2–11 and 34:17–29 to find answers to these questions regarding prayer. For example, they could answer questions like these: Where can we pray? What can we pray for? They might also find answers in the words of a hymn about prayer, such as "Did You Think to Pray?" or "Sweet Hour of Prayer" (Hymns, nos. 140, 142). How can we improve our prayers?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 34:9–17</heading>
<heading>The Savior's atoning sacrifice is "infinite and eternal."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Amulek used the words "infinite" and "eternal" several times to describe the sacrifice Jesus Christ made to atone for our sins. You might invite class members to find these words in Alma 34:9–14 and then look them up in a dictionary. In what ways is the Savior's sacrifice infinite and eternal? (see Hebrews 10:10; 2 Nephi 9:21; Mosiah 3:13). According to Alma 34:15–17, what must we do to receive the blessings of the Savior's sacrifice? What does it mean to "exercise your faith unto repentance"? (Alma 34:17).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 34:32–35</heading>
<heading>"Do not procrastinate the day of your repentance."</heading>
<ul>
<li>An analogy like the following could help class members ponder the dangers of procrastinating our repentance: invite them to imagine that they've received an invitation to participate in an event that requires years of training and preparation, such as an Olympic competition or a musical performance (pick something that's meaningful to your class), but this event will be held tomorrow. Discuss with the class why they probably would not succeed in the event even if they spend the rest of today preparing. How does this example relate to Amulek's warnings in Alma 34:32–35? Why might it be dangerous to delay our efforts to repent and change? Invite class members to ponder what they can do to "prepare for eternity" (verse 33) and make plans to do it without delay.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read Alma 36–38 this coming week, you could point out that Alma was "grieved for the iniquity of his people," so he gathered his sons and taught them "concerning the things pertaining unto righteousness" (Alma 35:15–16). The next several chapters of Alma give an account of what Alma was inspired to teach his sons.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>What does it mean to be humble?</heading>
<p>"To be humble is to recognize gratefully your dependence on the Lord — to understand that you have constant need for His support. . . . It is not a sign of weakness, timidity, or fear; it is an indication that you know where your true strength lies" (True to the Faith [2004], 86).</p>
<p>Elder Quentin L. Cook explained: "When we really contemplate God the Father and Christ the Son, who They are, and what They have accomplished on our behalf, it fills us with reverence, awe, gratitude, and humility. . . . Humility also includes being grateful for our numerous blessings and divine assistance. Humility isn't some grand identifiable achievement or even overcoming some major challenge. It is a sign of spiritual strength. It is having the quiet confidence that day by day and hour by hour we can rely on the Lord, serve Him, and achieve His purposes" ("The Eternal Everyday," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 52, 54).</p>

<p>As you prepare to teach, remember that class members have likely had meaningful experiences with Alma 36–38. What can you do to build upon those experiences?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>One way to encourage class members to share what they are learning in the scriptures is to divide the class into three groups and assign each group a chapter from Alma 36–38. Invite each group to find and share an inspiring verse from their chapter.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 36</heading>
<heading>We can be born of God as we are humble and repent.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some members of your class may wonder why they have never had a dramatic conversion experience like Alma's. It might help them if you shared what Elder David A. Bednar taught: "For many of us, conversion is an ongoing process and not a onetime event that results from a powerful or dramatic experience" ("Converted unto the Lord," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2012, 107–8). Although some things about Alma's conversion experience are uncommon, his experience teaches principles that we all need to apply to our own ongoing conversion. You could invite class members to search Alma 36 to find these principles and list them on the board. What else has helped us become more converted to the gospel of Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>Alma used the phrase "born of God" to describe his conversion. To help class members understand this concept, you could invite them to read the following verses individually or in pairs, looking for what it means to be born of God: 1 John 4:7; Mosiah 5:7; 27:25–26; and Alma 5:14; 22:15. Ask class members to share what they have learned. Then they could search Alma 36, looking for answers to this question: How do people feel and act when they are born of God? To help class members ponder how they are being born of God, you could share the statement by President Ezra Taft Benson found in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 37</heading>
<heading>The scriptures have been preserved "for a wise purpose."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps studying Alma's words as he gave sacred records to his son Helaman can help class members share how they have felt the power of the scriptures in their lives. Encourage them to review Alma 37 to find messages that Alma gave to Helaman about the scriptures (see especially verses 1–19 and 43–47). How do we show that the scriptures are sacred to us? How can we, like Alma, teach our loved ones to "keep all these things sacred"? (Alma 37:2). How do the scriptures "show forth [God's] power" to us? (Alma 37:14).</li>
<li>One way to learn about the blessings of having the scriptures is to study what Alma said in Alma 37 about the sacred records and other items he entrusted to Helaman. You could make a list on the board of the sacred items: the plates of Nephi and the brass plates (Alma 37:2–20), the 24 plates of Ether and the interpreters (Alma 37:21–37), and the Liahona (Alma 37:38–47). Class members could read these verses to learn what Alma taught about each of these items. In what ways can the scriptures enlarge our memories? (see Alma 37:8). What can we learn from Alma's words about the blessings of having the scriptures in our lives today?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The scriptures teach us how to follow God.</graphics-caption>
<heading>ALMA 37:6–7, 41–42</heading>
<heading>"By small and simple things are great things brought to pass."</heading>
<ul>
<li>To teach about the importance of "small and simple things" in God's work, Alma gave two examples: the scriptures and the Liahona (see Alma 37:6–7, 41–42; see also 1 Nephi 17:41). After reviewing these examples, perhaps class members could share examples from their own lives of small and simple things in God's work. You might want to contact one or two class members in advance and ask them to bring an object to class that is small and has brought about great things in their lives. You could also share the statement by President Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources." To help class members personalize this principle, you could ask questions like the following: Why do we sometimes fail to do the small and simple things? How can we inspire ourselves and our families to overcome this tendency?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 37:38–47</heading>
<heading>The words of Christ can guide us day by day.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Comparing the word of God to the Liahona could inspire class members to be more diligent and consistent about reading the scriptures. To guide a discussion about this, you might invite class members to read Alma 37:38–47 in pairs, looking for similarities between the Liahona and the word of God. You might challenge them to find a similarity in each verse. Then you could write each verse number on the board and ask class members to write the similarities they found next to the numbers. What does this comparison suggest about how we should approach our scripture study?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 38</heading>
<heading>Sharing our testimonies of Jesus Christ can strengthen those we love.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Alma's words to his son Shiblon provide a good example of how to strengthen and encourage those we love in living the gospel. Maybe class members could read this chapter and identify how Alma strengthened Shiblon. Alma 38 is short — you might even decide to read it as a class. Then class members could share passages that they found meaningful or that gave them ideas for strengthening their own family members and friends.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Have class members ever wondered how to counsel a loved one who made a serious mistake? Explain that they will find helpful insights in Alma 39–42.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Conversion is like a new birth.</heading>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson taught: "When we have undergone this mighty change, which is brought about only through faith in Jesus Christ and through the operation of the Spirit upon us, it is as though we have become a new person. Thus, the change is likened to a new birth. Thousands of you have experienced this change. You have forsaken lives of sin, sometimes deep and offensive sin, and through applying the blood of Christ in your lives, have become clean. You have no more disposition to return to your old ways. You are in reality a new person. This is what is meant by a change of heart" ("A Mighty Change of Heart," Ensign, Oct. 1989, 4).</p>
<heading>Small and simple things.</heading>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks taught:
"I was reminded of the power of small and simple things over time by something I saw on a morning walk. . . . The thick and strong concrete sidewalk [was] cracking. Is this the result of some large and powerful thrust? No, this cracking is caused by the slow, small growth of one of the roots reaching out from the adjoining tree. . . . 
"So is the powerful effect over time of the small and simple things we are taught in the scriptures and by living prophets. Consider the scripture study we've been taught to incorporate into our daily lives. Or consider the personal prayers and the kneeling family prayers that are regular practices for faithful Latter-day Saints. . . . Though each of these practices may seem to be small and simple, over time they result in powerful spiritual uplift and growth. This occurs because each of these small and simple things invites the companionship of the Holy Ghost, the Testifier who enlightens us and guides us into truth" ("Small and Simple Things," Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 90).</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To give class members an opportunity to share their thoughts and insights about Alma 39–42, you could invite them to briefly review these chapters and find something Alma said or did that impressed them.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ALMA 39</heading>
<heading>Sexual sin is an abomination in the sight of the Lord.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What can we learn from the account of Corianton's experience with sin and repentance? Perhaps class members could read Alma 39:1–14, some of them searching for what Corianton did wrong, others searching for what may have led him to sin, and others searching for counsel Alma gave him. As they share what they find, they could discuss how we can avoid making similar mistakes.</li>
<li>When people commit sexual sins, they often have feelings of discouragement or despair and can feel they don't have much worth. What principles in Alma 39–42 inspire class members to feel hope that leads to repentance? Sharing the statement by Sister Joy D. Jones in "Additional Resources" can help class members understand the difference between worthiness and our worth in the sight of God. (See also Lynn G. Robbins, "Until Seventy Times Seven," Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 21–23.)</li>
<li>As part of your discussion, it might be helpful for class members to discuss the Lord's standards regarding chastity. Your discussion may be more helpful if it centers on principles rather than on a list of dos and don'ts. For example, you could invite class members to identify principles that Alma taught Corianton in Alma 39. In addition, they could review "Sexual Purity" in For the Strength of Youth with questions like these in mind: "If you had to summarize all of this counsel with one principle, what would it be?" or "What principles do you find here that help you live the law of chastity?" Class members could also review this section in For the Strength of Youth, looking for the blessings of living the law of chastity and the consequences of disobeying this law. How are these principles different from what the world teaches? How do these principles affect the way we think about the law of chastity? Your class might benefit by reading Sister Wendy Nelson's statement in "Additional Resources" as they answer these questions.</li>
<li>It's sometimes easy to believe that our choices don't affect others — that our sins are private. What did Alma teach Corianton in Alma 39:11–12 about the effect of his choices? Invite class members to ponder who might be affected by the choices they are making, both good and bad. They could also share how the actions and examples of others have helped them choose the right.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 40–42</heading>
<heading>The Atonement of Jesus Christ makes the plan of redemption possible.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Alma taught Corianton truths we all need to understand, including truths about the purpose of life, the spirit world, resurrection, and judgment. Consider picking one of Alma's teachings and giving class members two minutes to search Alma 40–42 (individually or in pairs) and write down as many truths about that topic as they can find. Class members could then share with each other or with the class what they found. You could repeat this process for other topics as time allows. Why were these particular truths important for Alma's son Corianton to understand?</li>
<li>Alma's descriptions of the state of souls after this life can impress on class members' minds the importance of coming unto the Savior and repenting of our sins in this life. You could write<i>Righteous (Repentant)</i>and<i>Wicked (Unrepentant)</i>on the board and invite class members to search Alma 40:11–26 and list on the board words or phrases that Alma used to describe the state of each of these groups of people after they die. How can these teachings inspire us to repent? For more about what happens in the spirit world, see 1 Peter 3:18–20; 4:6 and Doctrine and Covenants 138:29–37.</li>
<li>What comes to the minds of your class members when they hear the words "restored" or "restoration"? Invite them to search Alma 41 for how Alma used these words. What did he mean by them? What will be restored to us? Why can it be helpful to see Heavenly Father's plan as a "plan of restoration"? (verse 2).</li>
<li>Some members of your class may share the question that seemed to be on Corianton's mind — is it just or fair that a loving God would punish His children? (see Alma 42:1). Maybe you could ask class members to ponder how they would respond to this question and search for answers in Alma 42:7–26.</li>
<li>If you feel it would be appropriate, members of your class might benefit from finding a verse in Alma 42 that they could depict with a simple drawing or symbol that explains why we need the Savior's Atonement. Class members could share what they drew, and the rest of the class could try to find the verse it represents. Then they could discuss what they learned about the importance of the Savior's sacrifice.</li>

<heading>The worth of our souls is great.</heading>
<p>Sister Joy D. Jones taught:
"Let me point out the need to differentiate between two critical words:<i>worth</i>and<i>worthiness</i>. They are not the same. Spiritual<i>worth</i>means to value ourselves the way Heavenly Father values us, not as the world values us. Our worth was determined before we ever came to this earth. «God's love is infinite and it will endure forever.»
"On the other hand,<i>worthiness</i>is achieved through obedience. If we sin, we are less worthy, but we are never worth less! We continue to repent and strive to be like Jesus with our worth intact. As President Brigham Young taught: «The least, the most inferior spirit now upon the earth. . . is worth worlds.» No matter what, we always have worth in the eyes of our Heavenly Father" ("Value beyond Measure," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 14).</p>
<heading>The world's view on intimacy is not consistent with God's view.</heading>
<p>Sister Wendy Nelson contrasted how the world views sexual relations — "worldly sex" — with what she called "God-ordained marital intimacy":
"With worldly sex, anything goes. With marital intimacy, exquisite care is taken to avoid anything and everything — from language to music to movies — that offends the Spirit, your spirit, or your spouse's.
"While worldly sex is lustful and kills love, marital intimacy generates more love.
"Worldly sex degrades men and women and their bodies, while marital intimacy honors men and women and celebrates the body as one of the great prizes of mortal life.
"With worldly sex, individuals can feel used, abused, and ultimately more lonely. With marital intimacy, spouses feel more united and loved, more nurtured and understood.
"Worldly sex ravages and eventually ruins relationships. Marital intimacy strengthens marriages. It supports, heals, and hallows the lives of spouses and their marriage. . .
"Worldly sex becomes a total obsession because it never fulfills its promises. God-ordained marital intimacy is glorious and will continue eternally for covenant-keeping husbands and wives" ("Love and Marriage" [worldwide devotional, Jan. 8, 2017], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</p>

<li>In their individual and family study this week, class members may have pondered or recorded their thoughts about how the Nephites successfully defended themselves against the Lamanites and how the Lamanites attacked the Nephites. If class members did this at home, invite them to share what they found. Or you could give class members time to find these insights during class using scriptures such as those found in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.

<heading>Satan tempts and deceives us little by little.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Your class may benefit from studying Alma 47, which shows how Amalickiah's treachery resembles what Satan does to deceive us. You could start by asking someone to summarize the account found in Alma 47. To add interest, you could invite two class members to imagine that they are Amalickiah and Lehonti and tell the story. What did Amalickiah do that reminds us of things Satan does to tempt and deceive us? Encourage class members to refer to specific verses as they discuss this question. The quotation in "Additional Resources" contains another good example of how Satan deceives us. What advice can we give each other to help us be aware of how Satan tempts us today? What can we do to protect ourselves?</li>

<li>A discussion about the attributes of Moroni could inspire class members to strive to follow his example. You might start by showing a picture of Moroni, such as the one in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families. Then invite class members to study Alma 44:3–4 and 48:7–13 and write on the board words and phrases that describe Moroni. You could then read together Alma 48:17 and discuss how Moroni's attributes, such as those listed on the board, allowed him to overcome the influence of Satan and become like Jesus Christ.

<heading>The consequences of giving in to small temptations.</heading>
<p>To teach that "serious sin enters into our lives as we yield first to little temptations," President Spencer W. Kimball shared this fable:
"[A] camel and his owner. . . were traveling across the desert sand dunes when a wind storm came up. The traveler quickly set up his tent and moved in, closing the flaps to protect himself from the cutting, grinding sands of the raging storm. The camel was of course left outside, and as the violent wind hurled the sand against his body and into his eyes and nostrils he found it unbearable and finally begged for entrance into the tent. 
"«There is room only for myself,» said the traveler.
"«But may I just get my nose in so I can breathe air not filled with sand?» asked the camel.
"«Well, perhaps you could do that,» replied the traveler, and he opened the flap ever so little and the long nose of the camel entered. How comfortable the camel was now! But soon the camel became weary of the smarting sand on his eyes and ears . . . 
"«The wind-driven sand is like a rasp on my head. Could I put just my head in?»
"Again, the traveler rationalized that to acquiesce would do him no damage, for the camel's head could occupy the space at the top of the tent which he himself was not using. So the camel put his head inside and the beast was satisfied again — but for a short while only.
"«Just the front quarters,» he begged, and again the traveler relented and soon the camel's front shoulders and legs were in the tent. Finally, by the same processes of pleading and of yielding, the camel's torso, his hind quarters and all were in the tent. But now it was too crowded for the two, and the camel kicked the traveler out into the wind and storm" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 106–7).</p>

<heading>As we exercise faith and trust in God, He will strengthen us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You can add richness to your class discussion about Helaman's warriors by drawing on what class members learned at home. One way to do this could be to invite class members to share characteristics of the stripling warriors that impress them (some of these can be found in Alma 53:17–21; 56:45–48; 57:20–21, 26–27; 58:40). How did these characteristics help the stripling warriors during their battles? How can they help us during our spiritual battles? Class members could also share stories of modern-day "stripling warriors."</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Heroes (Taught by their Mothers), by Liz Lemon Swindle</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>The parents in your class probably hope that their children will develop faith like Helaman's young warriors. To help parents and future parents in your class learn from their story, you could organize a panel of several individuals who can share ideas about building faith in children. Ask these panel members to read Alma 56:47–48 and 57:20–27 beforehand and prepare to share insights about what helped the stripling warriors develop faith. Give class members time to share their insights as the panel members present ideas. Other resources that could enhance this discussion include Sister Joy D. Jones's words in "Additional Resources" and President Russell M. Nelson's message "A Plea to My Sisters" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 95–97). At the end of the discussion, you could give class members a few minutes to ponder questions like the following: Who might be relying on your testimony? What can you say and do to strengthen them?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 58:1–12, 30–37; 61</heading>
<heading>We can choose to think the best of others and not be offended.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Helaman's reaction when his armies were not receiving support can be a powerful example for us when we feel wronged. To encourage a discussion about his example, you could invite a class member to come prepared to summarize Helaman's situation and the reasons the government was not responsive to his needs (see Alma 58:1–9, 30–37; 61:2–8). You could write on the board<i>Helaman's response</i>and<i>Other possible responses</i>. Then invite the class to search Alma 58:1–12 and 30–37 and write under each heading descriptions of what Helaman thought, said, and did in response to his situation and, in contrast, what he could have thought, said, or done. What can we do to follow Helaman's example when we feel wronged or neglected?</li>
<li>When Moroni criticized Pahoran in Alma 60, Pahoran could have chosen to take offense. Instead he responded that he was "not angry" and "[rejoiced] in the greatness of [Moroni's] heart" (Alma 61:9). To help class members learn from Pahoran's example, you could ask them to imagine that they have been asked to write an article for a Church magazine that draws on Pahoran's example in Alma 61 to teach about how to avoid being offended by others. You could then divide class members into groups and ask them to read Alma 61:3–14 and list some points that they might include in their articles. Elder David A. Bednar's counsel in "Additional Resources" could also help.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 60:7–14</heading>
<heading>We have a responsibility to lift those around us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Moroni wrote that God would hold Pahoran responsible if he knowingly neglected the needs of the Nephite armies. Consider inviting class members to read Alma 60:7–14 together, and then ask them to think of someone they know who might be in need and feeling neglected. What can we do to be aware of and meet the needs of others? How have our needs been met by others, including our ministering brothers and sisters?</li>
</ul>
<heading>ALMA 62:39–41, 48–51</heading>
<heading>We should remember the Lord during times of adversity and prosperity.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Nephites' reactions to both difficult and prosperous times (see Alma 62:39–41, 48–51) show that we can choose to be humble whether we are experiencing adversity or prosperity. You could invite class members to read these verses and share what impresses them. You might invite them to discuss their thoughts in pairs before asking a few to share with the whole class.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire interest in Helaman 1–6, you could explain to the class that in these chapters the Nephites become wicked and the Lamanites righteous. This role reversal holds important lessons for us in these perilous latter days.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Making our children sin resistant.</heading>
<p>Sister Joy D. Jones, Primary General President, shared the following keys to raising "a sin-resistant generation":
"To begin, . . . we must help [our children] know without question that they are sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father and that He has divine expectations of them.
"Second, understanding the doctrine of repentance is essential for becoming resistant to sin. Being sin-resistant doesn't mean being sinless, but it does imply being continually repentant, vigilant, and valiant. Perhaps being sin-resistant comes as a blessing from repeatedly resisting sin. . . . 
". . . A third key to helping children become sin-resistant is to begin at very early ages to lovingly infuse them with basic gospel doctrines and principles from the scriptures, the Articles of Faith, the For the Strength of Youth booklet, Primary songs, hymns, and our own personal testimonies — that will lead children to the Savior. . . . 
". . . Helping children understand, make, and keep sacred covenants is another key. . . . Teaching children to keep simple promises when they are young will empower them to keep holy covenants later in life" ("A Sin-Resistant Generation," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 88–89).</p>
<heading>How to avoid taking offense.</heading>
<p>In his message "And Nothing Shall Offend Them" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2006, 89–92), Elder David A. Bednar gave the following counsel:
Recognize that being offended is a choice. "To believe that someone or something can<i>make</i>us feel offended, angry, hurt, or bitter diminishes our moral agency and transforms us into objects to be acted upon. As agents, however, you and I have the power to act and to choose how we will respond to an offensive or hurtful situation."
Look to the Savior. "The Savior is the greatest example of how we should respond to potentially offensive events or situations [see 1 Nephi 19:9]."
Be understanding of others' weaknesses. "One of the greatest indicators of our own spiritual maturity is revealed in how we respond to the weaknesses, the inexperience, and the potentially offensive actions of others."
Communicate directly. "If a person says or does something that we consider offensive, our first obligation is to refuse to take offense and then communicate privately, honestly, and directly with that individual. Such an approach invites inspiration from the Holy Ghost and permits misperceptions to be clarified and true intent to be understood."</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Draw on experiences in the home.</b>Since the home is the center of gospel learning, consider how your classroom experiences can draw on what is happening there.

<heading>HELAMAN 1–6</heading>
<heading>Pride separates us from the Spirit and strength of the Lord.</heading>
<ul>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families describes a "pride cycle" that plagued the Nephites. Perhaps someone in the class could diagram this cycle on the board. Class members could then find verses in Helaman 1–6 that they feel illustrate the different parts of the cycle and write them beside the related parts on the diagram. (If class members need help, you could suggest that they look in Helaman 3:24–36; 4:11–26.) How are we sometimes like the Nephites? How can we avoid their tendency toward pride? You could also share portions of "Chapter 18: Beware of Pride" (Teachings of the Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson [2014], 229–40).</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption note="needs details">The "pride cycle."</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>You might invite class members to read Helaman 4:13 and 24–26 and find a hymn that teaches about our dependence on God, such as "I Need Thee Every Hour" (Hymns, no. 98). Why does pride separate us from God? How can we recognize our dependence upon God? Class members could share how they have been strengthened by the Lord's Spirit and power because they were humble.</li>
<li>The Church members described in Helaman 3:33–34 were persecuting fellow members of the Church. Because of their pride, they oppressed the poor and committed all kinds of other sins (see Helaman 4:11–13). Consider reading together Helaman 3:33–34 and 4:11–13 and asking class members to discuss ways we can show greater kindness and respect toward others, including our fellow Church members be different from us. You could also who may invite class members to think of someone they know who may be suffering because of others' unkind actions and ponder how they can help strengthen and encourage that person.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 3:33–35</heading>
<heading>Sanctification comes from yielding our hearts to God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Helaman 3:33–35 could be very comforting to those in your class who may be experiencing "persecutions. . . [or] much affliction" (verse 34). Perhaps you could invite class members to search these verses to find advice they might give to someone who is being persecuted. Or maybe class members could share how they found "joy and consolation" in times of affliction by doing the things described in verse 35.</li>
<li>Consider inviting the class to study Helaman 3:33–35 and the statements and references about becoming sanctified in "Additional Resources." What do these verses and statements teach about sanctification? How do fasting and prayer bring the blessings described in Helaman 3:35? How do we yield our hearts to God? (see Helaman 3:35). How does this help us become sanctified? You could also prepare and distribute slips of paper with one of the statements or references from "Additional Resources" printed on them and invite class members to randomly pick one to study. Then they could share with each other what they learned about sanctification.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 5:12</heading>
<heading>If we make Jesus Christ our foundation, we cannot fall.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Satan sends forth "his mighty winds" into all of our lives. Many people in your class have already experienced this, and more storms are likely in the future. What can you do to help your class members prepare for these storms by building their lives on Jesus Christ?</li>
<li>You might begin a discussion by showing pictures of temples or other buildings and comparing our lives to a building. What choices does a builder have to make? What choices do we make that affect how our lives are built? Then you could read together Helaman 5:12 and discuss what it means to build our lives on Jesus Christ. How does having Him as our foundation influence other choices we make as we build our lives?</li>
<li>Class members could share how having the Savior as their foundation has helped them withstand the storms of life. Give class members time to ponder the kind of life they are building and how they can ensure that they are firmly founded on Christ. The story about the Salt Lake Temple in "Additional Resources" can help in your discussion.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 5:14–50</heading>
<heading>Our faith is strengthened by "the greatness of the evidences [we have] received."</heading>
<ul>
<li>One of the blessings of gathering in Sunday School is the opportunity to strengthen one another's faith — just as the Lamanites did in Helaman 5:50. Perhaps you could read Helaman 5:50 together and ask the class to identify "the things which [the Lamanites] had heard and seen" in verses 20–49. Class members could then share with each other some of the spiritual experiences that have convinced them that the gospel is true — even if they haven't seen angels or pillars of fire. What convincing evidence have they seen of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Helaman 7–12 describes how Nephi earned the trust of the Lord and was given great power. You could suggest to your class that by reading these chapters, they can learn how to receive more of God's trust in their lives.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Becoming sanctified through Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Sanctification is "the process of becoming free from sin, pure, clean, and holy through the Atonement of Jesus Christ" (Guide to the Scriptures, "Sanctification," scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</li>
<li>"Once we have truly repented, Christ will take away the burden of guilt for our sins. We can know for ourselves that we have been forgiven and made clean. The Holy Ghost will verify this to us; He is the Sanctifier. No other testimony of forgiveness can be greater" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "Point of Safe Return," Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 101).</li>
<li>"To be sanctified through the blood of Christ is to become clean, pure, and holy. If justification removes the punishment for past sin, then sanctification removes the stain or effects of sin" (D. Todd Christofferson, "Justification and Sanctification," Ensign, June 2001, 22).</li>
<li>"When the will, passions, and feelings of a person are perfectly submissive to God and his requirements, that person is sanctified" (Brigham Young, "Discourse," Deseret News, Sept. 7, 1854, 1).</li>
<li>We are sanctified by the power of the Holy Ghost because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Hebrews 13:12; Alma 13:10–12; 3 Nephi 27:19–20; Moroni 10:32–33; D&amp;C 76:40–42).</li>
<li>Even after we have been sanctified, it is still possible to fall from divine grace (see D&amp;C 20:30–34).</li>
</ul>
<heading>A sure foundation.</heading>
<p>During the construction of the Salt Lake Temple, large cracks were found in the foundation stones. Even though it had taken almost nine years to get that far in the construction, President Brigham Young directed that the cracked foundation stones be removed and replaced with stones of a better quality. It took another five years to remove the defective foundation stones and rebuild up to the ground level. "I want to see that temple built," President Young said, "in a manner that it will endure through the millennium" ("Remarks," Deseret News, Oct. 14, 1863, 97).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Bear testimony of Jesus Christ.</b>Aminadab might not have felt like the most qualified person to teach the Lamanites to repent and have faith in Christ (see Helaman 5:35–41). But he shared what he knew, and his testimony had a profound influence. What do you learn from this example?</p>

<heading>HELAMAN 7–11</heading>
<heading>Prophets reveal the will of God to the people.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help your class learn from Helaman 7–11 about the roles and responsibilities of prophets, you could start by reading together the entry for "Prophet" in the Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Class members could identify the roles of prophets mentioned and list them on the board. You could then ask class members to each review one chapter from Helaman 7–11. Ask them to look for how Nephi fulfilled the roles listed on the board. How do our living prophets and apostles fulfill these roles? How can we sustain them in their responsibilities?</li>
<li>Why do prophets sometimes have to speak with boldness like Nephi did? Consider inviting class members to read Helaman 7:11–29, looking for the warnings Nephi gave and the reasons he had to be so bold in giving them. What prophetic warnings have inspired us to repent and come to the Lord? In "Additional Resources" you will find a metaphor that Elder Neil L. Andersen used to help us understand the dangers of ignoring prophetic warnings.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 9:1–20; 10:1, 11–15</heading>
<heading>Faith must be built on more than signs and miracles.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One way to discuss these verses is to divide the class into two groups and invite each group to read Helaman 9:1–20 and imagine themselves in the place of either the five men or the chief judges. What might these people have felt? What may have influenced each group to respond differently to the same miraculous prophecy? How can we ensure that miracles build our testimonies but do not become the only basis for them? How can we determine whether the prophet's words in our day are true?</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 10:1–12</heading>

<li>The account of the Lord blessing Nephi in Helaman 10 can inspire members of your class to be more diligent in seeking and doing the Lord's will. Class members could read verses 1–12, looking for what Nephi did to gain the Lord's trust and how the Lord blessed him. They could then share other examples of people who sought and did the Lord's will "with unwearyingness" (Helaman 10:4), either from the scriptures or their own lives. How did the Lord bless these people with power to "cast down" (Helaman 10:9) figurative mountains in their lives? Give class members time to ponder ways they can better seek the Lord's will and keep His commandments.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 12</heading>
<heading>The Lord wants us to remember Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many members of your class have made covenants to always remember Jesus Christ. Perhaps they could share with each other some things that help them "always remember him" (Moroni 4:3; D&amp;C 20:77), both in times of prosperity and times of difficulty. Then class members could search Helaman 12 for reasons people tend to forget the Lord. How can we overcome the tendencies described in this chapter? How has adversity helped us remember God? (see Helaman 11:4–7).</li>
<li>To demonstrate the effort it takes to remember something, you could give class members a few minutes to look over Helaman 12. Then you could ask them questions about the chapter to see what they remember. Maybe they could share what they do to remember information for a test. How is this similar to the effort that is required to "remember the Lord"? (Helaman 12:5). How is it different? Invite the class to find a verse or a phrase from Helaman 12 that they could display in their homes or memorize to remind them to remember the goodness and power of God.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read Helaman 13–16, you could point out that Samuel the Lamanite's prophecies of events associated with the Savior's birth and Crucifixion can be compared to events in our day that will precede the Savior's Second Coming.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Listen to the guidance of the prophets.</heading>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen shared the following experience:
"Those who choose to serve the Lord will always listen attentively and specifically to the Prophet. . . . 
". . . Let me illustrate with an experience. Our family lived for many years in the state of Florida. Because Florida has a high concentration of sand, lawns there are planted with a large broadleaf grass we call Saint Augustine. A formidable enemy of a Florida lawn is a small, brown insect called a mole cricket. 
"One evening as my neighbor and I stood on the front steps, he noticed a little bug crossing my sidewalk. «You better spray your lawn,» he warned. «There goes a mole cricket.» I had sprayed the lawn with insecticide not too many weeks previously, and I hardly felt that I had the time or money to do it again so soon. 
"In the light of the next morning, I examined my lawn closely. It was lush and beautifully green. I looked down into the grass to see if I could see any of the little bugs. I could see none. I remember thinking, «Well, maybe that little mole cricket was just passing through my yard on the way to my neighbor's yard.» . . . 
"The story, however, has a sad ending. I came out the front door one morning, about 10 days after the conversation with my neighbor. Shockingly, as if it had happened overnight, brown spots covered my lawn. I ran to the garden store, bought the insecticide, and sprayed immediately, but it was too late. The lawn was ruined, and to return it to its former state required a new crop of sod, long hours of work, and large expense.
"My neighbor's warning was central to my lawn's welfare. He saw things I could not see. He knew something I did not know. He knew that mole crickets live underground and are active only at night, making my daytime examinations ineffective. He knew that mole crickets did not eat the leaves of the grass but rather found nourishment in the roots. He knew that these little inch-long creatures could eat a lot of roots before I would ever see the effect above the ground. I paid a dear price for my smug independence. . . .
". . . There are spiritual mole crickets that burrow under our protective walls and invade our delicate roots. Many of these insects of wickedness appear small, at times almost invisible. . . . 
"Let us not follow the pattern I showed in dealing with my Florida mole crickets. Let us never ignore the warnings. Let us never be smug in our independence. Let us always be listening and learning in humility and faith, anxious to repent should it be necessary" ("Prophets and Spiritual Mole Crickets," Ensign, Nov. 1999, 16–18).</p>

<p><b>Express love.</b>"Depending on your circumstances, expressing love to those you teach may mean giving them sincere compliments, taking an interest in their lives, listening carefully to them, involving them in the lesson, performing acts of service for them, or simply greeting them warmly when you see them" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 6).</p>

<p>Which of Samuel the Lamanite's teachings and prophecies do you feel will be most helpful to members of your class? As you study Helaman 13–16, ponder how you can help them find meaning in these chapters.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Invite class members to share with a partner something they learned, something they understood better, or something they applied as they read the account of Samuel the Lamanite in Helaman 13–16 this week. Then let a few of them share with the entire class.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine HELAMAN 13</heading>
<heading>The Lord's servants speak and act according to God's direction.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Lord asked Samuel the Lamanite to do something that could have seemed quite difficult: to preach to people who had previously cast him out of their city. Reading Helaman 13:2–5 might remind class members of difficult things the Lord has asked them to do. Invite them to share their experiences. How did the Lord help them? For example, maybe class members could share experiences when the Lord put something in their heart that He wanted them to say to someone (see verse 4). What blessings have class members seen when they followed the Lord's direction?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The prophet points us to Jesus Christ.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>Even though Samuel's warnings were addressed to the hard-hearted Nephites, Helaman 13 holds some lessons for all of us. To help class members find personal meaning in his words, you could invite them to search Helaman 13 for a message that seems relevant to our day. (If they need help, you might write the following verses on the board: 8,21–22, 26–29, 31, and 38.) Then they could share what they find in pairs, in small groups, or with the entire class. What similar messages have prophets given us today?</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 14; 16:13–23</heading>
<heading>Signs and wonders can strengthen the faith of those who do not harden their hearts.</heading>
<ul>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests looking for signs that the Lord has given us "that [we] might believe on his name" (Helaman 14:12). Perhaps class members could share what they discovered as they pondered this idea. Be sure to point out that the signs in our lives could be less dramatic and more personal than the signs Samuel predicted. What other purposes for signs are suggested in Helaman 14:28–30? Class members could also share other things the Lord has done to help them develop faith in Him.</li>
<li>Reading about how Samuel's prophecies were fulfilled could build class members' faith in Jesus Christ and His mission. Maybe class members could use Helaman 14 to create a chart that lists Samuel's prophecies of Christ's birth and death on one side and scripture references where these prophecies were fulfilled on the other. Some of these references might include verses from 3 Nephi 1:15–21 and 3 Nephi 8:5–25. Why is it important for us to know about these prophecies and their fulfillment?</li>
<li>Class members may have noticed — in Helaman 16 and other places in the scriptures — that seeing signs and wonders does not necessarily cause one to believe in Christ. Invite them to share some examples from the scriptures of individuals who saw signs and yet did not believe. According to Helaman 16:13–23, why did many people in Samuel the Lamanite's time not believe the signs and prophecies? How does Satan persuade people to "depend upon their own strength and . . . wisdom" today? (Helaman 16:15). What do we learn from this account that can help us avoid similar errors?</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 15:3</heading>
<heading>The Lord chastens those He loves.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Samuel's words contain many stern chastisements, but Helaman 15:3 gives a unique perspective on chastening from the Lord. One way to help class members understand this perspective is to read this verse together and invite them to share evidence they see of God's love and mercy in Samuel's prophecies and warnings. How could chastisement from the Lord be a sign of His love?</li>
<li>To help class members better understand the message in Helaman 15:3, you could share three purposes for divine chastening taught by Elder D. Todd Christofferson (see "Additional Resources"). Divide the class into three groups, and ask each group to discuss one of these purposes (the scriptures and video suggested in "Additional Resources" can help). Then each group could share with the class any insights from their discussion that help them better understand that the Lord chastens those He loves.</li>
</ul>
<heading>HELAMAN 16</heading>
<heading>The prophet points us to the Lord.</heading>
<ul>
<li>In Helaman 16, what do we learn from those who accepted Samuel's teachings? What do we learn from those who rejected him? It could be inspiring to hear class members share how they gained their testimony of the importance of following the living prophets. They might also share how they would use Helaman 16 or Elder Andersen's words in "Additional Resources" to explain to someone why they choose to follow the prophet.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read 3 Nephi 1–7 next week, you could tell them that many of the prophecies they read about this week will be fulfilled in these chapters.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Purposes of divine chastening.</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson shared three purposes of divine chastening (see "As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten," Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 97–100):
1. "To persuade us to repent." See Ether 2:14–15; Doctrine and Covenants 1:27; 93:41–50; 105:6.
2. "To refine and sanctify us." See Mosiah 23:21–22; Doctrine and Covenants 101:1–5; 136:31.
3. "To redirect our course in life to what God knows is a better path." See the story of President Hugh B. Brown and the currant bush in Elder Christofferson's talk (pages 98–99); "The Will of God" (video, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</p>
<heading>We rejoice to have a prophet.</heading>
<p>Elder Neil L. Andersen taught:
"A prophet does not stand between you and the Savior. Rather, he stands beside you and points the way to the Savior. A prophet's greatest responsibility and most precious gift to us is his sure witness, his certain knowledge, that Jesus the Christ. Like Peter of old, our prophet declares, «[He is] the Christ, the Son of the living God» [Matthew 16:16; see also John 6:69]. 
"In a future day, looking back on our mortality, we will rejoice that we walked the earth at the time of a living prophet. At that day, I pray that we will be able to say:
"We listened to him. We believed him. We studied his words with patience and faith. We prayed for him. We stood by him. We were humble enough to follow him. We loved him" ("The Prophet of God," Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 27).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Get to know those you teach.</b>No two people are exactly alike. Each person you teach has a unique background, perspective, and set of abilities. Pray to know how you can use these differences to help class members learn. As you better understand those you teach, you can create meaningful and memorable teaching moments. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 7.)</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>To help class members share what they are learning at home, ask them to write on pieces of paper some truths they found in 3 Nephi 1–7 and the scripture references for the truths. Put the pieces of paper into a container, and draw out several to discuss as a class. As class members share, consider if there are related ideas in this outline that can deepen the discussion and engage other members of the class.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>3 NEPHI 1–7</heading>
<heading>Conversion is a process that requires diligent effort.</heading>
<ul>
<li>3 Nephi 1–7 describes people who were converted to Jesus Christ and His gospel and others who were not. To help your class identify what made the difference between these groups, you could create a chart on the board with the following headings:<i>Beliefs and actions that weaken conversion</i>and<i>Beliefs and actions that strengthen conversion.</i>Divide the following scripture references among class members, and invite them to fill in the chart with what they find (examples are provided for the first reference).
3 Nephi 1:4–23, 29–30:<i>Weaken conversion:</i>not believing the prophet's words and making fun of righteous people (verses 5–6).<i>Strengthen conversion:</i>having faith in the prophet's words and praying for help (verses 8, 11).
3 Nephi 2:1–3
3 Nephi 3:12–16
3 Nephi 4:8–10, 30–33
3 Nephi 6:13–18
3 Nephi 7:15–22
How can we keep our conversion strong despite opposition?</li>
<li>Your class might be interested in exploring how to strengthen what 3 Nephi 1:27–30 calls "the rising generation." You might ask class members to find reasons in these verses why the young Nephites and Lamanites were not able to resist the wickedness around them. This could lead to a discussion about some of the challenges facing today's rising generation and the best ways to help them develop faith in Christ. Some suggestions are found in "Additional Resources."</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 1:4–21; 5:1–3</heading>
<heading>The Lord will fulfill all His words.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Reading the accounts in 3 Nephi 1:4–21 and 5:1–3 could strengthen your class members' faith in the Lord's promises. Perhaps class members could read together 3 Nephi 1:4–7 and list on the board how they might feel if they were the believers described in these verses. They could also think of similar circumstances we might face today. What do we learn from 3 Nephi 1:8–21 and 5:1–3 about the Lord and His promises? To broaden the discussion, you could review a hymn about trusting God, such as "When Faith Endures" (Hymns, no. 128). Class members could share experiences when their faith and trust in God was rewarded, despite opposition.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 1:4–15; 5:12–26; 6:10–15; 7:15–26</heading>
<heading>We are disciples of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Mormon declared, "Behold, I am a disciple of Jesus Christ" (3 Nephi 5:13). To explore with your class what it means to be a disciple, you might invite class members to search 3 Nephi 1:4–15; 5:12–26; 6:10–15; and 7:15–26, looking for qualities, beliefs, and actions of disciples of Christ. Consider giving class members a few minutes to ponder and write down something they can do to become a better disciple of Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 2:11–12; 3:12–26; 5:24–26</heading>
<heading>When the righteous gather, the Lord can strengthen and protect them.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Part of the reason the Nephites were able to defeat the Gadianton robbers was that they joined forces with the converted Lamanites and followed the inspired direction of Lachoneus to "gather themselves together" in Zarahemla (3 Nephi 3:22). What lessons might this hold for your class members? You could ask them to share experiences when they were strengthened by the righteous people around them. You could then invite class members to review 3 Nephi 3:12–26, looking for reasons the Nephites gathered and the blessings they experienced. How do we experience these same blessings when we gather with members of our families or branches and wards? What more can we learn about gathering from 3 Nephi 5:24–26?</li>
<li>Reading 3 Nephi 3 could be an opportunity to help class members see how much stronger we are when we gather together in righteousness. Perhaps you can think of an object lesson that shows how something that is weak becomes stronger when united with other things. Invite class members to imagine that they were asked to convince the Nephites of the benefits of gathering together, as described in verses 12–26. Perhaps they could work in groups to discuss how to do this, based on what they read in these verses. Let them share their ideas. As a class, you might then discuss questions like these: What challenges do we face that might be likened to the Gadianton robbers? How can we make our homes and our ward places of refuge?</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 3:1–13</heading>
<heading>We need not fear Satan.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The epistle written by Giddianhi, the leader of the Gadianton robbers, was an attempt to intimidate and deceive the Nephites. Perhaps class members could review his words found in 3 Nephi 3:2–10 and compare them to ways Satan might try to deceive us today. What do we learn from the reaction of Lachoneus, the chief judge of the Nephites?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire your class members to read 3 Nephi 8–11 for next week's class, tell them that 3 Nephi 11 contains "the crowning event" of the Book of Mormon — Jesus Christ's personal ministry among the Nephites (see the introduction to the Book of Mormon).</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Helping build faith in the rising generation.</heading>
<p>Elder Valeri V. Cordón of the Seventy suggested three ways to help the rising generation stay true to the gospel:
1. "<i>Being More Diligent and Concerned at Home. . . .</i>Powerful teaching is extremely important to preserve the gospel in our families, and it requires diligence and effort. We have been invited many times to acquire the practice of daily family and personal scripture study. Many families that are doing this are blessed each day with greater unity and a closer relationship with the Lord." ¶ 2. "<i>Strong Modeling in the Home. . . .</i>It is not enough just to talk to our children about the importance of temple marriage, fasting, and keeping the Sabbath day holy. They must see us making room in our schedules to attend the temple as frequently as we can. They need to see our commitment to fasting regularly and keeping the entire Sabbath day holy." ¶ 3. "<i>Traditions. . . .</i>As families, we need to avoid any tradition that will prevent us from keeping the Sabbath day holy or having daily scripture study and prayer at home. We need to close the digital doors of our home to pornography and all other evil influences. To combat the worldly traditions of our day, we need to use the scriptures and the voice of our modern prophets to teach our children about their divine identity, their purpose in life, and the divine mission of Jesus Christ" ("The Language of the Gospel," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 56–57; italics added). </p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Sometimes people are more likely to share if you ask for something specific. For example, you could invite class members to share something from 3 Nephi 8–11 that has taught them about the character of Jesus Christ. You might extend this invitation a few days in advance so that they can come prepared to share.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>3 NEPHI 8–10</heading>
<heading>If we repent, the Savior will gather, protect, and heal us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>These chapters contain accounts of destruction and devastation, but they also teach spiritual lessons that can help us come closer to Jesus Christ. Perhaps you could divide the class into three groups and assign each group to search one chapter from 3 Nephi 8–10, looking for words or phrases that describe what the people learned or experienced. One person from each group could then share with the rest of the class what their group discovered. Encourage class members to discuss how these spiritual lessons can help us come closer to the Savior.</li>
<li>A valuable message in these chapters is that the Savior reaches out to us with love and mercy even during our most difficult trials. You might invite class members to think of someone they know who is going through a challenging time and then search the Savior's words in 3 Nephi 9:13–22 and 10:1–10 to find phrases that might help that person. Perhaps class members could also share personal experiences when they felt the Savior reach out to them.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 9:19–22</heading>
<heading>The Lord requires "a broken heart and a contrite spirit."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Before the Savior's coming, the faithful in the promised land obeyed the law of Moses, which included the sacrifice of animals. To help class members better understand this law, you could briefly review Moses 5:5–8. Why were God's people commanded to sacrifice animals anciently? What new commandment did the Savior give in 3 Nephi 9:20, and how does it point us toward Him and His sacrifice? The quotations about the law of sacrifice in "Additional Resources" can help.</li>
<li>How can you help class members understand what it means to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit? Perhaps you could begin by writing on the board the words broken, contrite, and sacrifice. Then you could ask class members to draw pictures that represent what these words mean to them or write words or phrases that they associate with these terms. As class members share their pictures, words, or phrases, they could discuss how these relate to what the Savior asks of us in 3 Nephi 9:19–22. The quotation by Elder D. Todd Christofferson in "Additional Resources" can also help.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 11:1–17</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ is the Light of the World.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The events described in 3 Nephi 11:1–17 are among the most sacred in the Book of Mormon. Consider allowing your class members a few moments to read these verses in silence. Perhaps you could write a few questions on the board for them to ponder as they read, such as these:<i>How would you have felt if you were among these people? What impresses you about the Savior in these verses? What do you learn from Jesus's example?</i>or<i>What experiences have given you a witness of Jesus Christ as your Savior?</i>You could allow class members to share some of their thoughts or impressions.</li>
</ul>

<heading>3 NEPHI 11:10–41</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ established His doctrine and His Church.</heading>
<ul>
<li>It may be instructive to note the first things the Savior chose to say and do when He appeared in the land Bountiful. Maybe class members could mark or write down truths they identify from the Savior's words and actions in 3 Nephi 11:10–41. Invite them to share what they found. What do we learn about the Savior from these verses? What do we learn about His Church?</li>
<li>In order to end apparent disagreements among the people related to baptism, the Savior revealed important truths about this ordinance in 3 Nephi 11. To help class members discover these truths, you could write the following verse numbers on the board:<i>21–25, 26–27, 33–34.</i>Invite each class member to pick a verse or two and share a truth it teaches about baptism.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Your class may be interested to know that the Savior's visit to the Nephites and Lamanites affected them so profoundly that these formerly contentious people lived in peace for the next 200 years (see 4 Nephi 1). This might inspire class members to study 3 Nephi 12–16 to learn what the Savior taught the people that may have led to such a dramatic change.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>The law of sacrifice.</heading>
<p>President M. Russell Ballard explained one way we live the law of sacrifice today:
"After the Savior's ultimate sacrifice, two adjustments were made in the practice of [the law of sacrifice]. First, the ordinance of the sacrament replaced the ordinance of sacrifice; and second, this change moved the focus of the sacrifice from a person's animal to the person himself. In a sense, the sacrifice changed from the<i>offering</i>to the<i>offerer</i>. . . .
"Instead of the Lord requiring our animals or grain, now He wants us to give up all that is ungodly. . . . 
"When we overcome our own selfish desires and put God first in our lives and covenant to serve Him regardless of the cost, we are then living the law of sacrifice" ("The Law of Sacrifice," Ensign, Oct. 1998, 10).</p>
<p>Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: "Real, personal sacrifice never was placing an animal on the altar. Instead, it is a willingness to put the animal in us upon the altar and letting it be consumed!" ("Deny Yourselves of All Ungodliness," Ensign, May 1995, 68).</p>
<heading>A broken heart and a contrite spirit.</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson described what it means to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit:
"You can offer the Lord the gift of your broken, or repentant, heart and your contrite, or obedient, spirit. In reality, it is the gift of yourself — what you are and what you are becoming. 
"Is there something in you or in your life that is impure or unworthy? When you get rid of it, that is a gift to the Savior. Is there a good habit or quality that is lacking in your life? When you adopt it and make it part of your character, you are giving a gift to the Lord" ("When Thou Art Converted," Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 12).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Work together with family members.</b>"The people who have the most powerful influence on an individual — for good or ill — are usually those in his or her home. Because the home is the center of gospel living and learning, your efforts to strengthen a class member will be most effective when you work together with . . . family members" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 8–9).</p>

<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests summarizing passages in 3 Nephi 12–14 to complete the phrase "True disciples of Jesus Christ. . ." You could ask if any class members who did this activity would be willing to share what they learned. Or you could write the incomplete phrase on the board, along with references like these:<i>3 Nephi 12:3–16, 38–44; 13:1–8, 19–24;</i>and<i>14:21–27</i>(or other passages you found in your personal study). Class members could choose a passage to read, individually or in groups, and suggest a way to complete the phrase on the board based on what those verses teach. Encourage class members to ponder and perhaps write down what they will do to follow Jesus Christ more faithfully because of what they learned from these verses.</li>
<li>To help class members understand the Savior's words in 3 Nephi 12:48, you could invite one or more of them to study Elder Jeffrey R. Holland's message "Be Ye Therefore Perfect — Eventually" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 40–42) before class and share insights that help them understand this verse.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 12:21–30</heading>
<heading>Our thoughts lead to actions.</heading>
<ul>
<li>A discussion of 3 Nephi 12:21–30 could help class members see how controlling our thoughts can help us control our actions. To begin a discussion, you could make a table on the board with headings like<i>Actions We Want to Avoid</i>and<i>Thoughts or Emotions That Lead to Them.</i>Then you could invite class members to search 3 Nephi 12:21–22 and 27–30 and begin filling in the table. What other actions and thoughts could class members add to the lists? How can we "suffer none of these things to enter into" our hearts? (3 Nephi 12:29). How can we drive them out when they do enter? After reading President Ezra Taft Benson's counsel in "Additional Resources," you might create a new table with the headings<i>Christlike Actions We Want to Develop</i>and<i>Thoughts That Lead to Them</i>and fill it out as a class.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 13:1–8, 16–18</heading>
<heading>Our service and worship must be done for the right reasons.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Studying 3 Nephi 13 presents an opportunity for class members to examine why they do good works. To begin a discussion, you could read together verses 1–2 and 16 and share this definition of<i>hypocrites:</i>"Pretenders; the Greek word [used in the New Testament] means «a play actor,» or «one who. . . exaggerates a part»" (Matthew 6:2, footnote<i>a</i>). Perhaps one or two class members would enjoy pretending or acting as if they are giving to the poor or fasting. Why is pretending or acting a good metaphor for hypocrisy? How can we make sure our service, prayer, and fasting are sincere and free from hypocrisy?</li>
<li>After identifying the good works mentioned in 3 Nephi 13:1–8 and 16–18, class members could discuss what motives might lead a person to do these things or other things God asks us to do. What would we say to someone who asks us why we do good things? Encourage class members to ponder their personal motivations for doing good works like these. How can we purify our motives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 14:7–11</heading>
<heading>If we seek "good things" from Heavenly Father, we will receive.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To understand the Lord's invitation to ask, seek, and knock, it might help to explore what these words mean. What does each word imply about what the Lord invites us to do? How do we ask, seek, and knock? How have the promises in 3 Nephi 14:7–8 been fulfilled in our lives? Class members could also review President Russell M. Nelson's counsel in "Additional Resources," looking for the questions he asks and the invitations he gives. Give class members time to ponder and write down their answers to his questions and their plans to act on his invitations.</li>
<li>Some class members might be uncertain about what the Savior meant when He said, "Every one that asketh, receiveth" (3 Nephi 14:8). Why do some prayers seem to go unanswered, and why do we sometimes get answers we don't want? Reviewing some of the following scriptures as a class could help answer these questions: Isaiah 55:8–9; Helaman 10:4–5; 3 Nephi 18:20; and Doctrine and Covenants 9:7–9; 88:64. Encourage class members to share what they find. How might these insights affect how we pray?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to read 3 Nephi 17–19 at home, you could invite them to imagine what it would be like to hear the Savior pray for them and their families. In these chapters they will read about people who had this sacred experience.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>We can control our thoughts.</heading>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson taught:
"The mind has been likened to a stage on which only one act at a time can be performed. From one side of the wings the Lord, who loves you, is trying to put on the stage of your mind that which will bless you. From the other side of the wings the devil, who hates you, is trying to put on the stage of your mind that which will curse you.
"You are the stage manager — you are the one who decides which thought will occupy the stage. . . . You will be what you think about — what you consistently allow to occupy the stage of your mind. . . . 
"If thoughts make us what we are, and we are to be like Christ, we must think Christlike thoughts" ("Think on Christ," Ensign, Apr. 1984, 10–11).</p>
<heading>God wants to speak to you.</heading>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson said:
"What will your seeking open for you? What wisdom do you lack? What do you feel an urgent need to know or understand? Follow the example of the Prophet Joseph. Find a quiet place where you can regularly go. Humble yourself before God. Pour out your heart to your Heavenly Father. Turn to Him for answers and for comfort.
"Pray in the name of Jesus Christ about your concerns, your fears, your weaknesses — yes, the very longings of your heart. And then listen! Write the thoughts that come to your mind. Record your feelings and follow through with actions that you are prompted to take. . . . 
"Does God really<i>want</i>to speak to you? Yes! I urge you to stretch beyond your current spiritual ability to receive personal revelation. . . .
"Oh, there is so much more that your Father in Heaven wants you to know" ("Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives," Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 95).</p>

<heading>3 NEPHI 17; 18:24–25, 28–32</heading>
<heading>The Savior is our perfect example of ministering.</heading>
<ul>
<li>We all have opportunities to minister to others, and we can all be better at it. One way to learn from the Savior's example of ministering is to simply read 3 Nephi 17 as a class and invite class members to comment whenever they find something that teaches them about ministering. What do we learn about the Savior's character that made Him a great example of ministering? What truths do we learn about ministering from the Savior's example? You could also look for additional insights in 3 Nephi 18:24–25 and 28–32. Class members could then discuss specific things they feel inspired to do to follow the Savior's example of ministering.</li>

<heading>The Savior taught us how to pray.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members learn from the many examples of and teachings about prayer in 3 Nephi 17–19, you could write on the board<i>Who? How? When?</i>and<i>Why?</i>and invite the class to look for answers to these questions as they relate to prayer in the following verses: 3 Nephi 17:13–22; 18:15–25; and 19:6–9, 15–36. What other insights do class members gain as they read these verses? The statement by Elder Richard G. Scott in "Additional Resources" might add to the discussion. You could also invite class members to share what they do to make their personal and family prayers more meaningful (see 3 Nephi 18:18–21).</li>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests questions to ponder about prayer when reading these verses. You could ask class members to share any insights they have about these questions. Or you could invite several class members to come to class prepared to discuss something they learned about prayer from 3 Nephi 17–19. What were they inspired to do to make their prayers more meaningful?</li>
<li>Jesus taught why we should pray always (see 3 Nephi 18:15–18). An object lesson may help your class understand what He taught. For example, you might fill a container with water to represent Satan's influence. Stuff a tissue (which represents us) securely into the bottom of a cup (which represents praying always). Turn the cup upside down, and push it straight down into the container of water. The tissue should remain dry in the bottom of the cup, even though it is surrounded by water. What do this object lesson and 3 Nephi 18:15–18 teach us about prayer? (see also D&amp;C 10:5). What does it mean to "pray always"? How can prayer help us resist the influence of Satan? Consider allowing class members a few moments to write down what they feel impressed to do to improve their prayers.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 18:1–12</heading>
<heading>We can be spiritually filled as we partake of the sacrament.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To begin a discussion about the Savior's teachings on the sacrament in 3 Nephi 18, you could divide your class into groups and give each group one of the following scriptures to read and discuss: Matthew 26:26–28; 3 Nephi 18:1–12; and Doctrine and Covenants 20:75–79; 27:1–4. After reading their assigned passage, each group could think of a question or two about the sacrament that is answered in the verses they read and write their questions on the board. Then the rest of the class could search the scriptures for answers to the questions. Class members could also discuss how they can have a more meaningful experience partaking of the sacrament.</li>
<li>What does it mean to be "filled" as we partake of the sacrament? (see 3 Nephi 18:4–5, 9; 20:9). Consider inviting class members to discuss this question in pairs as they read 3 Nephi 18:1–12 together. You could also invite class members to ponder the last time they felt spiritually "filled" when partaking of the sacrament. Maybe they could discuss things that might prevent or distract us from being "filled" by the sacrament and share ideas about how to overcome those obstacles.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 19:9–15, 20–22</heading>
<heading>Disciples of Jesus Christ seek the gift of the Holy Ghost.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Consider asking class members to think of something they deeply desire. What are they willing to do to receive it? This could lead to a discussion about what the twelve disciples "most desired," as described in 3 Nephi 19:9–15 and 20–22. Why might this have been so important to them? Why is it important to us? According to these verses, how can we earnestly seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>The Lord said, "Great are the words of Isaiah" (3 Nephi 23:1). To encourage class members to read 3 Nephi 20–26, you could tell them that in these chapters, Jesus explained some of Isaiah's "great" words. Invite class members to ponder why these words of Isaiah are great. Encourage them to come ready next Sunday to share what they learn.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>The value of prayer.</heading>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott testified of the value of prayer:
"We pray to our Heavenly Father in the sacred name of His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ. Prayer is most effective when we strive to be clean and obedient, with worthy motives, and are willing to do what He asks. Humble, trusting prayer brings direction and peace.
"Don't worry about your clumsily expressed feelings. Just talk to your compassionate, understanding Father. You are His precious child whom He loves perfectly and wants to help. As you pray, recognize that Father in Heaven is near and He is listening. 
"A key to improved prayer is to learn to ask the right questions. Consider changing from asking for the things you want to honestly seeking what He wants for you. Then as you learn His will, pray that you will be led to have the strength to fulfill it.
"Should you ever feel distanced from our Father, it could be for many reasons. Whatever the cause, as you continue to plead for help, He will guide you to do that which will restore your confidence that He is near. Pray even when you have no desire to pray. Sometimes, like a child, you may misbehave and feel you cannot approach your Father with a problem. That is when you most need to pray. Never feel you are too unworthy to pray.
"I wonder if we can ever really fathom the immense power of prayer until we encounter an overpowering, urgent problem and realize that we are powerless to resolve it. Then we will turn to our Father in humble recognition of our total dependence on Him. It helps to find a secluded place where our feelings can be vocally expressed as long and as intensely as necessary" ("Using the Supernal Gift of Prayer," Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 8).</p>

<p>After reading together the Savior's words in 3 Nephi 23:1, you could ask class members what they searched for as they read the scriptures this week. What did they find?</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>3 NEPHI 20:25–41; 21:9–11, 22–29</heading>
<heading>In the latter days, God will perform a great and marvelous work.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The Savior spoke of "a great and a marvelous work" (3 Nephi 21:9) that His Father would do in the last days. Perhaps class members could share what they learned about that work as they studied these chapters at home. Questions like these could inspire a discussion: What did the Savior say would happen in a future day? (see especially 3 Nephi 20:30–32, 39–41; 21:22–29). Why would He call these things "great" and "marvelous"? What evidence do we see that this work is taking place? How do we participate in it?</li>
<li>To help class members see how the Prophet Joseph Smith helped fulfill the Lord's great and marvelous work, you could display a picture of the Prophet and invite the class to read 3 Nephi 21:9–11, looking for words and phrases that remind them of the life and ministry of Joseph Smith. For example, how did the Lord "give unto him power that he shall bring [the gospel] forth unto the Gentiles"? (verse 11). Why is it important to know that Joseph Smith's ministry was foretold by the Savior? (see also 2 Nephi 3).</li>
<li>You could also help class members see themselves in the great work foretold in these chapters by reading together 3 Nephi 20:25–27. If necessary, you could point out that when we make covenants with the Lord, we become the seed of Abraham. How can we as the descendants of Abraham bless "all the kindreds of the earth"? (verse 25). Class members could ponder this question as they read President Russell M. Nelson's statement in "Additional Resources" and share their thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 23; 26:1–12</heading>
<heading>The Savior wants us to search the scriptures.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What do the Savior's interactions with the Nephites reveal about the way He feels about the scriptures? To help class members find out, you could ask half of them to read 3 Nephi 23 and the other half to read 3 Nephi 26:1–12; then they could share with each other what they found. They could also share ideas they have about how to show the Lord that the scriptures are important to us. For example, what is the difference between searching the scriptures and simply reading them? (see 3 Nephi 23:1).</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 24:1–6</heading>
<heading>The Lord is like a refiner's fire.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Visual aids might enhance your discussion of 3 Nephi 24:1–6. For example, you could show a silver coin or some soap while class members read the verses to find out how these items relate to the Savior and His mission. You could also share with the class the explanation of silver refining and fuller's soap in "Additional Resources." Or you could show the video "The Refiner's Fire" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). How is the Lord "like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap"? (verse 2). What do these examples teach us about how the Savior purifies us?</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 24:7–18</heading>
<heading>God is merciful to those who return to Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>You might point out that the teachings about tithing in 3 Nephi 24:8–12 are in response to the question in verse 7: "Wherein shall we return [to the Lord]?" What is the relationship between returning unto the Lord and paying tithing? Class members could share how they have received the blessings listed in verses 10–12 as they have paid tithing. How could these truths be helpful to someone who is struggling to pay tithing?</li>
<li>What attitude described in 3 Nephi 24:13–15 is often found in today's world? Encourage class members to share what they would say to someone who feels that life is easier or better for those who do not keep the commandments. According to 3 Nephi 24, how does the Lord bless those who serve Him? You might also encourage them to find examples in 3 Nephi 22. (See also Mosiah 2:41; Alma 41:10.)</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 25:5–6</heading>
<heading>Our hearts should turn to our ancestors.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To illustrate the concept of turning our hearts to our ancestors, you could invite a class member to turn away from the class and describe class members from memory (where they are sitting, what they are wearing, and so on). Then he or she could turn toward the class and try again. What can this example teach us about turning our hearts to our ancestors through temple and family history work? After reading 3 Nephi 25:5–6, perhaps class members could share how their hearts have turned to their ancestors. You could also invite the ward temple and family history consultant to introduce them to some family history tools. How does this work relate to the gathering of Israel described by President Russell M. Nelson in "Additional Resources"?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>In 3 Nephi 27–4 Nephi we read about the "[happiest] people among all the people who had been created by the hand of God" (4 Nephi 1:16). Suggest to the class that reading these chapters could help us learn how to find happiness for ourselves and our families.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>You can be part of something grand.</heading>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson declared:
"These surely<i>are</i>the latter days, and the Lord is hastening His work to gather Israel. That gathering is the most important thing taking place on earth today. Nothing else compares in magnitude, nothing else compares in importance, nothing else compares in majesty. And if you choose to, if you want to, you can be a big part of it. You can be a big part of something big, something grand, something majestic!
"When we speak of<i>gathering</i>, we are simply saying this fundamental truth: every one of our Heavenly Father's children, on both sides of the veil, deserves to hear the message of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. . . .
"... Think of it! Of all the people who have ever lived on planet earth, we are the ones who get to participate in this final, great gathering event. How exciting is that! ... 
"This gathering should mean<i>everything</i>to you. This is the mission for which you were sent to earth" ("Hope of Israel" [worldwide devotional for youth, June 3, 2018], broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</p>
<heading>Refining and purifying.</heading>
<p>Silver is found mixed with other minerals in deposits of ore. Anciently, a refiner of silver would extract the silver by placing the ore in a furnace heated to extreme temperatures. This would cause dross (impurities or unwanted minerals) to emerge on the surface of the molten ore. The refiner would scrape the dross away, leaving pure silver, which could be identified by its distinctive glow.
A fuller was someone who cleansed and whitened cloth. The cloth would be immersed in water mixed with "fuller's soap," which was designed to remove oil and dirt. While the cloth was soaking, the fuller would beat or stamp it to remove impurities. (See "Refiner's Fire and Fuller's Soap," New Era, June 2016, 6–7.)</p>

<p>One way to encourage class members to share insights from their personal study is to invite them to find a hymn related to a truth they learned in 3 Nephi 27–4 Nephi. They could then share the hymns they found and how these hymns relate to the scriptural truths.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>3 NEPHI 27:1–22</heading>
<heading>The Church of Jesus Christ is called in His name and is built upon His gospel.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Discussing the name of the Church might deepen your class members' appreciation for their membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Consider inviting class members to list names of various organizations and describe what the names tell us about those organizations. Then class members could read 3 Nephi 27:1–12, looking for what the Savior taught about the name of His Church. They could also share what it means to them to be members of Christ's Church. What does it mean to take His name upon ourselves?</li>
<li>Here's another way to discuss the importance of the name of the Savior's Church. After a discussion of truths found in 3 Nephi 27:1–22, you could write the full name of the Church on the board. Then class members could select words in the name and suggest how each word helps us know who we are or what we believe. President M. Russell Ballard's statement in "Additional Resources" could help. Why is it important to use the name of the Church as we share our beliefs with others?</li>
<li>After explaining that His Church must be "built upon [His] gospel" (3 Nephi 27:10), the Savior described what His gospel is. Perhaps you could invite class members to share how they might explain to a friend what the gospel is. Then you could invite them to search 3 Nephi 27:13–22, looking for how the Savior defined His gospel. How would we summarize what the Savior said? As we study the Savior's definition of the gospel, what insights do we gain about how to live the gospel in our daily lives?</li>
</ul>
<heading>3 NEPHI 29–30</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon is a sign that God's latter-day work is being fulfilled.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Perhaps you could start a discussion about 3 Nephi 29–30 by talking about signs. For example, class members could name signs that let us know that a storm is coming or that the seasons are changing. Then they could read 3 Nephi 29:1–3 to learn what is signified by the coming forth of the Book of Mormon, which Mormon called "these sayings" (see also 3 Nephi 21:1–7). What message did the Lord give in 3 Nephi 29:4–9 to those who would "spurn" or "deny" the work of God in the last days? How does reading the Book of Mormon daily strengthen our faith in those things that other people "spurn" or "deny" in our day? You may want to invite class members to read the Lord's invitation in 3 Nephi 30 and share how the Book of Mormon has helped them accept this invitation.</li>
</ul>
<heading>4 NEPHI</heading>
<heading>Conversion to Jesus Christ and His gospel leads to unity and happiness.</heading>
<ul>
<li>The account in 4 Nephi illustrates the joy that can come into our lives — as individuals, as families, and as a ward or stake — as we strive to be more fully converted to Jesus Christ. Consider asking class members to search 4 Nephi 1:1–18 and write on the board the blessings that came to the people when they were all converted to the Lord. How did their conversion affect how they treated each other? Perhaps class members could share how the gospel has brought similar blessings to their families or their ward. To help class members understand how each of us can live more like the people in 4 Nephi and how we can encourage greater unity and happiness among those around us, you could read the statement by Elder D. Todd Christofferson in "Additional Resources." Class members could assess their personal efforts in the three areas Elder Christofferson described.</li>
<li>The people of the Book of Mormon had distinguished themselves as Nephites and Lamanites — and many other "-ites" — for centuries, but after the Savior's ministry among them, these distinctions disappeared. After reading 4 Nephi 1:17 together, perhaps class members could share their thoughts about what kinds of "-ites" or groups exist in our society today. What can we do to overcome such divisions and truly become "one, the children of Christ"? (verse 17).</li>
<li>What can class members learn from the decline of the Zion society described in 4 Nephi? You could invite them to search 4 Nephi 1:19–34, looking for what ended the happiness and unity the people experienced in the nearly 200 years following the Savior's visit. What truths in these verses can help us identify attitudes and behaviors that need to change in our lives and in our society?</li>

<heading>The name of Christ's Church.</heading>
<p>President M. Russell Ballard said:
"I have thought a lot about why the Savior gave the nine-word name to His restored Church. It may seem long, but if we think of it as a descriptive overview of what the Church is, it suddenly becomes wonderfully brief, candid, and straightforward. How could any description be more direct and clear and yet expressed in such few words?
"Every word is clarifying and indispensable. The word<i>The</i>indicates the unique position of the restored Church among the religions of the world.
"The words<i>Church of Jesus Christ</i>declare that it is His Church [see 3 Nephi 27:8]. ...
"<i>Of Latter-day</i>explains that it is the same Church as the Church that Jesus Christ established during His mortal ministry but restored in these latter days. We know there was a falling away, or an apostasy, necessitating the Restoration of His true and complete Church in our time.
"<i>Saints</i>means that its members follow Him and strive to do His will, keep His commandments, and prepare once again to live with Him and our Heavenly Father in the future.<i>Saint</i>simply refers to those who seek to make their lives holy by covenanting to follow Christ" ("The Importance of a Name," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 80).</p>
<heading>What will it take to build Zion?</heading>
<p>Elder D. Todd Christofferson taught: "Zion is Zion because of the character, attributes, and faithfulness of her citizens [see Moses 7:18]. ... If we would establish Zion in our homes, branches, wards, and stakes, we must rise to this standard. It will be necessary (1) to become unified in one heart and one mind; (2) to become, individually and collectively, a holy people; and (3) to care for the poor and needy with such effectiveness that we eliminate poverty among us. We cannot wait until Zion comes for these things to happen — Zion will come only as they happen" ("Come to Zion," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 38).</p>

<heading>MORMON 1–6</heading>
<heading>We can live righteously despite the wickedness around us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Many of your class members can understand Mormon's experience with striving to live righteously in a wicked world. Maybe they could share what they learn from Mormon's example. To help facilitate this discussion, you could invite class members to find verses that identify Mormon's qualities and make a list of those qualities on the board (see, for example, Mormon 1:2–3, 15–16; 2:1, 23–24; 3:1–3, 12, 17–22). How would these qualities have helped Mormon remain spiritually strong? How can they help us be more like Mormon?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Mormon frequently wrote directly to people in our day. What can we learn from his words to us in Mormon 3:17–22 and 5:10–24? Give each class member a piece of paper with the phrase "Mormon's Counsel to Us" written at the top, and encourage them to find messages in these verses that are relevant for our day. How can we apply Mormon's counsel to help us stay spiritually strong in today's world?</li>
<li>If you teach youth, you could use Mormon's example to help them understand that they can be righteous leaders when they are young. If you teach adults, you could use his example to prompt a discussion about opportunities to help the youth be good leaders. To start the discussion, you could ask some class members to review Mormon 1 and others to review Mormon 2, noting the opportunities Mormon was given to lead during his early years. What qualities did he have that made him a great leader? Class members could share examples they have seen of the powerful influence of righteous children and youth. They could also discuss opportunities they — or young people they know — have to be leaders with qualities like Mormon had.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORMON 2:10–15</heading>
<heading>Repentance requires a broken heart and a contrite spirit.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To learn about the difference between sorrow that leads to repentance and sorrow that does not, consider reading Mormon 2:10–15 together and discussing questions like these: What is the role of "sorrowing" in repentance? What is the difference between "sorrowing ... unto repentance" and the "sorrowing of the damned"? What attitudes and behaviors can help us have "broken hearts and contrite spirits"?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORMON 3:12</heading>
<heading>We can love others, even if we don't agree with their choices.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Like Mormon, many members of your class associate closely with people who do not share their beliefs. How might you use Mormon's experience to teach class members about loving others despite their differences? Consider reading Mormon 3:12 together and discussing times when Mormon showed love for those who rejected his message and willfully rebelled against God (see, for instance, Mormon 1:16–17; 2:12). What experiences can class members share from their own lives of loving those who did not share their beliefs or values? The statement by President Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources" gives additional counsel.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORMON 6:17</heading>
<heading>Jesus Christ stands with open arms to receive us.</heading>
<ul>
<li>For those who might have no hope that they can be forgiven for their sins, Mormon's description of the Savior standing "with open arms to receive you" could provide reassurance. Consider reading Mormon 6:17 together and showing a picture of Jesus Christ with outstretched arms (such as Gospel Art Book, no. 66). What does this verse teach about the Savior's eagerness to help us? You could also consider singing a hymn together that teaches a similar message, such as "Come unto Jesus" (Hymns, no. 117). You might also share President Russell M. Nelson's experience in "Additional Resources" and ask class members to discuss how we can help others recognize that repentance is possible.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>You could ask class members to think about what they would write in a letter to people in the future. In Mormon 7–9 we read what Mormon and Moroni wrote, centuries ago, to people in our day.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Loving others who believe differently.</heading>
<p>President Dallin H. Oaks explained:
"We should all follow the gospel teachings to love our neighbor and avoid contention. Followers of Christ should be examples of civility. We should love all people, be good listeners, and show concern for their sincere beliefs. Though we may disagree, we should not be disagreeable. Our stands and communications on controversial topics should not be contentious. We should be wise in explaining and pursuing our positions and in exercising our influence. In doing so, we ask that others not be offended by our sincere religious beliefs and the free exercise of our religion. We encourage all of us to practice the Savior's Golden Rule: «Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them» (Matthew 7:12).
"When our positions do not prevail, we should accept unfavorable results graciously and practice civility with our adversaries" ("Loving Others and Living with Differences," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 27).</p>
<heading>Repentance is possible.</heading>
<p>President Russell M. Nelson shared the following experience:
"Last year while Elder David S. Baxter and I were driving to a stake conference, we stopped at a restaurant. Later when returning to our car, we were approached by a woman who called out to us. ... She asked if we were elders in the Church. We said yes. Almost unrestrained, she told the story of her tragic life, swamped in sin. Now, only 28 years old, she was miserable. She felt worthless, with nothing to live for. As she spoke, the sweetness of her soul began to emerge. Pleading tearfully, she asked if there was any hope for her, any way up and out of her hopelessness.
"«Yes,» we responded, «there is hope. Hope is linked to repentance. You can change. You can 'come unto Christ, and be perfected in him'» [Moroni 10:32]. We urged her not to procrastinate [see Alma 13:27; 34:33]. She sobbed humbly and thanked us sincerely.
"As Elder Baxter and I continued our journey, we pondered that experience. We recalled the counsel given to a hopeless soul by Aaron, who said, «If thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, ... then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest» [Alma 22:16]. ..."
"... To the 28–year-old woman mired in the swamp of sin, and to each one of us, I declare that the sweet blessing of repentance is possible. It comes through complete conversion to the Lord and His holy work."
In addition, President Nelson observed: "We also remember the sinful people under the care of their concerned leader, Mormon, who wrote, «I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of the Lord which should come upon them; for they repented not of their iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without calling upon that Being who created them» (Mormon 5:2)" ("Repentance and Conversion," Ensign or Liahona, May 2007, 102, 104).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Spiritual growth occurs at home.</b>Your class members spend 165 hours each week outside of church. During that time, they have their own spiritual experiences that teach them about the gospel.

<heading>MORMON 7:8–10; 8:12–22; 9:31–37</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon is of great worth.</heading>
<ul>
<li>One way to introduce a discussion about the great worth of the Book of Mormon is to talk about how we determine the value of an item. How does knowing the value of something change the way we use it? Class members could search Mormon 8:12–22 and share what Moroni said about the value of the Book of Mormon ("this record"). They could also share personal experiences that have shown them the value of the Book of Mormon. How can we show that we value the Book of Mormon?</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>The Book of Mormon clarifies doctrine taught in the Bible.</graphics-caption>
<ul>
<li>To help class members recognize how the Book of Mormon and the Bible support each other, you could invite them to read Mormon 7:8–10 and summarize Mormon's description of the two records in their own words ("the record which shall come unto the Gentiles from the Jews" refers to the Bible). Consider drawing two overlapping circles on the board and labeling one the Bible and the other the Book of Mormon. Class members could list similarities between the two books of scripture in the overlapping section and differences in the other sections. (The video "Bible and Book of Mormon" on ChurchofJesusChrist.org provides insights.) Alternatively, consider listing several gospel truths on the board and inviting class members to look in the Guide to the Scriptures to find verses from the Book of Mormon and the Bible that help them understand the truths.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORMON 8:1–11</heading>
<heading>We can be faithful even when we are alone.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Some people in your class may feel alone in their efforts to live the gospel. What can they learn from the example of Moroni that could help them? Consider inviting class members to read Mormon 8:1–11 and think of questions they would like to ask Moroni to learn about how he remained faithful despite his difficult circumstances. What inspires them about his example? As they share their thoughts, encourage class members to share personal experiences when they or others they know remained faithful, even when they felt alone. How did the Lord help them?</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORMON 8:26–41; 9:1–30</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon was written for our day.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As you are approaching the end of this year's study of the Book of Mormon, perhaps class members could reflect on why they feel this book was written for our day. You could begin the discussion by reading the statement by President Ezra Taft Benson in "Additional Resources." Class members could then apply President Benson's questions to Mormon 8:26–41. Why did the Lord inspire Moroni to include these words in the record? How do they help us in our day?</li>
<li>As taught in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families, Mormon 9:1–30 contains Moroni's message in response to the lack of belief in Jesus Christ in our day. Perhaps you could divide the class into three groups and invite each group to find counsel that is helpful to them in the following verses: 1–6 (the consequences of not believing in Christ), 7–20 (the importance of believing in a God of revelation and miracles), and 21–30 (Moroni's counsel to us).</li>
<li>Even though Mormon 9:1–6 was written to "those who do not believe in Christ," it is helpful for all of us to imagine standing before God one day to be judged. Ask class members to review these verses, looking for words or phrases that describe how the wicked will feel on that day. What can we do to avoid these feelings? Class members may find helpful insights in the story told by President Boyd K. Packer in "Additional Resources."</li>
<li>Many people today believe that miracles have ceased. How can you use Moroni's teachings to help your class members believe in a "God of miracles"? You might start by asking class members to review Mormon 9:7–26 and look for the miracles that Moroni urged us to believe in. What do we learn from these verses about God and His work in our day? What must we do in order for God to work miracles? (see Mormon 9:20–21). What miracles have we seen?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Do members of your class ever wonder how they can increase their faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? If so, invite them to search Ether 1–5 for ways to help their faith grow.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>The Book of Mormon was written for our day.</heading>
<p>President Ezra Taft Benson said:
"The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us. ...
"Each of the major writers of the Book of Mormon testified that he wrote for future generations [see 2 Nephi 25:21; Jacob 1:3; Mormon 7:1; 8:34–35]. ... 
"If they saw our day, and chose those things which would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how we should study the Book of Mormon? We should constantly ask ourselves, «Why did the Lord inspire Mormon (or Moroni or Alma) to include that in his record? What lesson can I learn from that to help me live in this day and age?»" ("The Book of Mormon — Keystone of Our Religion," Ensign, Nov. 1986, 6).</p>
<heading>We can be spotless.</heading>
<p>President Boyd K. Packer told of traveling for six days as a young man with a military crew in a hot, smoky freight train, with no way to bathe or change clothes. At a train stop, the hungry crew went to a restaurant.
"It was crowded, and so we joined a long line waiting to be seated. I was first, just behind some well-dressed women. Even without turning around, the stately woman in front of me soon became aware that we were there.
"She turned and looked at us. Then she turned and looked me over from head to toe. There I stood in that sweaty, dirty, sooty, wrinkled uniform. She said in a tone of disgust, «My, what untidy men!» All eyes turned to us.
"No doubt she wished we were not there; I shared her wish. I felt as dirty as I was, uncomfortable, and ashamed."
President Packer then quoted Mormon 9:4 and compared his experience to being spiritually unclean in the presence of God. Testifying that the Atonement of Jesus Christ was the only way he could become spiritually clean, he then said:
"Can you imagine how I felt when finally I could see that if I followed whatever conditions the Redeemer had set, I need never endure the agony of being spiritually unclean? Imagine the consoling, liberating, exalting feeling that will come to you when you see the reality of the Atonement and the practical everyday value of it to you individually" ("Washed Clean," Ensign, May 1997, 9–10).</p>

<p>What truths did you learn during your personal study of Ether 1–5 that you can share with those you teach? What opportunities can you give them to share what they learned?</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Consider this creative way to invite sharing: Pass out stones to 16 class members, and invite a few of them to share a truth they remember from their personal or family study of Ether 1–5. What are they going to do because of what they learned?</p>

<heading>ETHER 1–3; 4:8–19</heading>
<heading>As we continually call upon the Lord, He will reveal His will.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Every one of us has struggled to find an answer to a problem or question. How can the brother of Jared's experiences help those you teach learn how to seek help from the Lord? Perhaps you could draw a table on the board with columns labeled<i>The brother of Jared's question, The brother of Jared's action,</i>and<i>The Lord's response</i>. Then you could divide the class into three groups and assign one column to each group. Each group could work together to scan Ether 1:33–43 and 2:16–3:6 and write what they find in their assigned column. Afterwards the class could discuss questions like these: What do we learn about the various ways the Lord may choose to help us? What do we learn about our role in the process of receiving revelation? Perhaps class members could share other examples from the scriptures that teach similar principles. The statement from Elder Richard G. Scott in "Additional Resources" provides further insights about how the Lord answers prayers.</li>
<li>The brother of Jared's prayer in Ether 3:1–5 might inspire class members to evaluate their personal prayers. Perhaps class members could imagine that they were giving counsel to someone who is just learning how to pray. What advice would they give? Then they could search Ether 3:1–5 and summarize each verse with one or two tips or principles about how to pray effectively. Consider giving class members a few minutes to think about their own prayers and how they can follow the brother of Jared's example to make their prayers more meaningful.</li>
<li>After sharing the brother of Jared's revelatory experience in Ether 3, Moroni gave counsel in Ether 4 about how we can receive revelation from the Lord. To help class members learn from this counsel, you could display a picture of Jesus Christ and invite class members to search Ether 4:8–10 for things that can prevent us from receiving revelation or truth from the Lord. As class members share what they find, you could slowly cover the picture of Christ with a cloth or piece of paper. How can we avoid these spiritual barriers in our lives? Next, class members could search Ether 4:7, 11–15, looking for how we can qualify to receive truth from the Lord. As class members share what they find, remove the cloth or piece of paper. What does it mean to "exercise faith in. . . the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did"? (Ether 4:7; see also Ether 3:1–9). What does it mean to "rend [the] veil of unbelief" in our lives? (Ether 4:15). How can we help others do the same? Class members could also look for truths about personal revelation in President Russell M. Nelson's message "Revelation for the Church, Revelation for Our Lives" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 93–96).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ETHER 2:14–15</heading>
<heading>Through His chastening, the Lord invites us to repent and come unto Him.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Even a prophet as great as the brother of Jared received chastening from the Lord. In fact, part of what made him great was the way he responded to chastening. To help class members learn from the brother of Jared's example, you could invite them to read Ether 2:14–15 together in pairs. Then ask them to pretend that one of them is the brother of Jared and the other is someone who has just received chastening from a Church leader or parent. Have them discuss or role-play what the brother of Jared might say about his own experience to help this person. What counsel might he give? What lessons do we learn that will help us draw closer to Heavenly Father? You could also discuss how the Lord's chastening and the brother of Jared's response may have helped prepare him for the experience he had in Ether 3:1–20. Here are some other resources that can help: Elder D. Todd Christofferson's message "As Many as I Love, I Rebuke and Chasten" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2011, 97–100) or the section titled "Discipline" in Elder Lynn G. Robbins's message "The Righteous Judge" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 96–97).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ETHER 5</heading>
<heading>Three witnesses testify of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Learning more about Moroni's prophecy of the Three Witnesses could help strengthen class members' testimonies of the Book of Mormon. Perhaps half of the class could read Ether 5 and the other half could read "The Testimony of Three Witnesses" (at the beginning of the Book of Mormon) and share with each other what they feel the Lord's purpose was in allowing the Three Witnesses to see an angel and the plates. They could also discuss other instances in which multiple witnesses establish truth (see, for example, Matthew 3:13–17; 18:15–16; John 5:31–47; D&amp;C 128:3). What witnesses in our lives have inspired us to believe? How has "the power of God and also his word" been "shown forth" to us in the Book of Mormon? (Ether 5:4).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Invite class members to imagine that their political leaders were continually capturing and killing one another. In Ether 6–11, they will read about how this happened to the descendants of Jared and his brother. They will also find some warnings that will help them avoid the problems the Jaredites faced.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Recognizing answers to prayer.</heading>
<p>Elder Richard G. Scott taught:
"When we explain a problem and a proposed solution, sometimes He answers yes, sometimes no. Often He withholds an answer, not for lack of concern, but because He loves us — perfectly. He wants us to apply truths He has given us. For us to grow, we need to trust our ability to make correct decisions. We need to do what we feel is right. In time, He will answer. He will not fail us. ... 
"... He wants us to act to gain needed experience:
"When He answers yes, it is to give us confidence. 
"When He answers no, it is to prevent error.
"When He withholds an answer, it is to have us grow through faith in Him, obedience to His commandments, and a willingness to act on truth. We are expected to assume accountability by acting on a decision that is consistent with His teachings without prior confirmation. We are not to sit passively waiting or to murmur because the Lord has not spoken. We are to act" ("Learning to Recognize Answers to Prayer," Ensign, Nov. 1989, 31–32).</p>

<heading>ETHER 6:1–12</heading>
<heading>The Lord will guide us through our mortal journey.</heading>
<ul>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests comparing the Jaredites' voyage across the sea to our journey through mortality. Ask class members who tried this activity at home to share insights they gained from this analogy. To help class members make further comparisons in class, invite them to look in Ether 6:1–12 for details about the voyage that could have symbolic meaning (such as the shining stones, the barges, and the wind) and list them on the board. Then class members could spend several minutes working in pairs or small groups to study the verses and discuss what these symbols might represent in our lives. For example, what is our "promised land"? (verse 8). How does God guide us on our journey?</li>
<li>You could use Ether 6:1–12 to inspire a discussion about how turning to God helps us grow through our trials. For example, the quotation in "Additional Resources" can help class members compare the "furious wind" mentioned in verses 5–8 with the adversities of life. What did the Jaredites do when they "were encompassed about by many waters"? (verse 7). Class members could share experiences in which their adversities helped drive them forward. How did the way they responded to their trials help them progress toward their "promised land"? How did the Lord help them through their struggles? Encourage them to refer to words and phrases from Ether 6 as they share their experiences and thoughts.</li>

<heading>The Lord blesses us when we are humble.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Although much of the story of the Jaredites illustrates the negative consequences of pride and wickedness, it also includes periods of humility and prosperity that we can learn from. To help class members learn from these positive examples, you could divide the class into two groups and assign one group to read Ether 6:7–18 and 30 while the other group reads Ether 9:28–35 and 10:1–2. Ask them to look in these verses for evidence that the Jaredites had humbled themselves — or were humbled by their circumstances and how the Lord blessed them as a result. When class members have had sufficient time, invite members from each group to share what they learned. How does being humble help us draw closer to God? Singing or listening to a hymn about humility, such as "I Need Thee Every Hour" (Hymns, no. 98), could add to this activity.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ETHER 7–11</heading>
<heading>Righteous leaders direct people to God.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Even those who have never held a formal leadership position can learn from the examples of righteous and wicked Jaredite kings; these accounts can help us become better leaders in our homes, in our communities, and at church. Maybe you could start a discussion on this topic by asking class members to think about someone they consider to be a good leader. Invite them to share briefly some of that person's qualities, and make a list on the board. Then you could assign each class member to learn about one of the Jaredite kings in Ether 7–11. (A list of kings, with references to scriptures that describe their reign, is found in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families.) Class members could share what they learn from these kings about leadership, adding other qualities they find to the list on the board. Other positive leadership qualities are listed in "Additional Resources." How can we develop these qualities and be leaders, even if we don't have a specific leadership assignment?</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To spark class members' interest in reading Ether 12–15, you might mention that in these chapters Moroni expressed to the Lord some of his insecurities about the record he was keeping. The Lord's response can help us when we have similar feelings of inadequacy.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Our trials prepare us to receive eternal life.</heading>
<p>Speaking in a general conference during the difficult years of World War II, Elder Charles A. Callis of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles said: "We are told that when the Jaredites in their barges set forth for this land of promise, fierce and terrible tempests prevailed. The winds blew and they were in imminent danger all the while on that perilous journey. God sustained them. And we read that although these gales and tempests raged, holding destruction in their wake, that the wind was continually blowing toward the Promised Land. And these adversities through which we are passing, these terrible wars and all the horrible things that are prevailing, are in the power of God. He can stop them when He chooses, when His divine purposes are fulfilled. But let us not forget that through this sea of trouble, our adversities, the experiences through which we pass and which God will make work together for our good, if we will obey Him — all these are blowing us forward to the haven of rest, to a glorious future, to eternal life" (in Conference Report, Apr. 1943, 62).</p>
<heading>Qualities of righteous leaders.</heading>
<p>"In God's kingdom, greatness and leadership means seeing others as they truly are — as God sees them — and then reaching out and ministering to them. It means rejoicing with those who are happy, weeping with those who grieve, lifting up those in distress, and loving our neighbor as Christ loves us. ...
"... Leadership in the Church is not so much about directing others as it is about our willingness to be directed by God" (Dieter F. Uchtdorf, "The Greatest among You," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 79–80).</p>
<p>"Only the wholesome have the capacity to lift and encourage one another to greater service, to greater achievement, to greater strength" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Ezra Taft Benson [2014], 244).</p>
<p>"The world teaches that leaders must be mighty; the Lord teaches that they must be meek. Worldly leaders gain power and influence through their talent, skill, and wealth. Christlike leaders gain power and influence «by persuasion, by long-suffering, by gentleness and meekness, and by love unfeigned» [D&amp;C 121:41]" (Stephen W. Owen, "The Greatest Leaders Are the Greatest Followers," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 75).</p>

"I have a testimony of ..." and "I have experienced ..." Invite class members to share something from Ether 12–15 that could complete one of the statements on the board.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>ETHER 12:2–22</heading>
<heading>We will receive a witness of truth as we exercise faith in Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members ponder what it means to exercise faith in Jesus Christ, you could ask them what images or words come to mind when they hear the word exercise. (You might even look the word up in a dictionary.) What effect does physical exercise have on our bodies? How can we apply this principle to faith? In what ways can we "exercise faith" in Christ? Class members could search Ether 12:2–22 and discuss how the people mentioned in these verses exercised faith. How can we follow their examples? According to these verses, what are the results of exercising faith in Jesus Christ? The examples of faith in Ether 12:7–22 provide a good review of inspiring stories you've studied together in the Book of Mormon. Perhaps class members could share other examples of faith and what they learn from them (others can be found in Hebrews 11). They could also share faithful examples from their family history or their own lives. How have these examples strengthened their faith in Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father?</li>
<li>Ether 12 is full of insights and truths about faith. Class members could find verses in this chapter that teach them about faith. They could then write on the board what they discover.</li>
</ul>
<heading>ETHER 12:1–9, 28, 32</heading>
<heading>Faith leads to "hope for a better world."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Can someone in your class describe why an anchor is important to a boat? You could show a picture of a boat and an anchor (or draw one on the board) and discuss what would happen to a boat that has no anchor. What happens to us when we have no hope? Class members could then read Ether 12:4 and talk about how hope is like "an anchor to [our] souls." They could also read Ether 12:1–9, 28, and 32 and share insights they gain about hope. What should we hope for? (see Ether 12:4; Moroni 7:41; see also John 16:33).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ETHER 12:23–29</heading>
<heading>Through the grace of Jesus Christ, weak things can become strong.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help class members personalize the truths Moroni learned about weakness and strength in Ether 12, you could invite class members to think of someone who may be feeling discouraged because of their weaknesses. Then encourage class members to search Ether 12:23–29 to find messages that could help that person. If Moroni were here today, what might he say to encourage him or her? Class members could also share experiences from their own lives when the Savior has helped "weak things become strong unto them" (Ether 12:27). How is this change different from self-improvement efforts that a person might make without relying on the Savior? For more on this topic, see the statement by President Henry B. Eyring in "Additional Resources."</li>
<li>Moroni's experience is one of many in the scriptures that show how the Savior's grace can turn our weaknesses into strengths. It might be helpful to divide the class into groups, assign each group to pick someone in the scriptures who had a weakness, and discuss how the Lord made that person strong. Some examples are suggested in "Additional Resources." You might also suggest that class members review the definition of grace in the Bible Dictionary or True to the Faith (pages 77–78). How do the scriptural examples they studied illustrate the power of the Savior's grace? How do we invite this power into our lives?</li>
<li>It's common to compare our weaknesses to another's perceived strengths; even Moroni felt he compared unfavorably to the brother of Jared (see Ether 12:24). Why is it dangerous to compare ourselves to others? According to Ether 12:26–27, how does the Lord want us to see our weakness? (see also the statement by President Henry B. Eyring in "Additional Resources"). How does He want us to see the weakness of others? (see Ether 12:26).</li>
</ul>
<heading>ETHER 13–15</heading>
<heading>Rejecting the prophets brings spiritual danger.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Given the important truths taught in Ether 12, you may not choose to spend a lot of time in class on chapters 13–15. However, it may be useful to ask a class member to briefly summarize what happens in these chapters. To help class members find meaningful messages in this account, you could ask them to complete the phrase "thus we see. . ." with a lesson they learn from the fall of the Jaredites. How was their fall similar to the fall of the Nephites? (see, for example, Ether 15:19 and Moroni 8:28). What does the Lord want us to learn from these accounts, and what can we do to avoid the fate of the Jaredites? Class members could also review how the end of the book of Ether connects with Omni 1:19–22; Mosiah 8:8; and Mosiah 28:11–18.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Next week class members will start studying the book of Moroni. They might find it interesting to know that Moroni had not originally planned to write anything more after the book of Ether, but he remained alive longer than he expected. This week they will begin reading the last messages that Moroni was inspired to write before he died.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Spiritual progress requires seeing our weaknesses.</heading>
<p>President Henry B. Eyring, commenting on Ether 12:27, taught: "Moroni said that when he «heard these words,» he «was comforted» (Ether 12:29). They can be a comfort to all of us. Those who do not see their weaknesses do not progress. Your awareness of your weakness is a blessing as it helps you remain humble and keeps you turning to the Savior. The Spirit not only comforts you, but He is also the agent by which the Atonement works a change in your very nature. Then weak things become strong" ("My Peace I Leave with You," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 16).</p>

<p><b>Teach the "why."</b>"Sometimes learners — especially youth — wonder how gospel principles relate to them or why they should obey certain commandments. However, if they understand Heavenly Father's eternal plan for the happiness of His children, the reasons for gospel principles and commandments become clearer and the motivation to obey increases" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 20).</p>

<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Sometimes class members are better able to share insights from their personal study when they have a little time to remember what they read. You might take a few minutes at the beginning of class to review the chapter headings for Moroni 1–6. (This could also help class members who didn't read at home.) Then invite class members to search the chapters for a verse they find meaningful and would like to share with the rest of the class.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MORONI 2–6</heading>
<heading>Priesthood ordinances must be administered as the Lord commands.</heading>
<ul>
<li>If members of your class (or their loved ones) are preparing to receive priesthood ordinances, it might be valuable to review what Moroni taught about ordinances in Moroni 2–6. Class members could work in pairs to role-play scenarios like the following. (1) Your brother is about to be ordained to the priesthood. What counsel would you give from Moroni 3? (2) A friend of another faith wonders why it's necessary to partake of the sacrament every week. What would you say? (see Moroni 4–5). (3) Your daughter's baptism is approaching, but she isn't sure she's ready. How would you help her? (see Moroni 6:1–3). After the role plays, the class could discuss what they learned from each other. They could also share their testimonies about how ordinances like these have brought them closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.</li>
<li>To introduce a discussion about preparing for baptism, you could ask a class member to describe ways they have prepared for important commitments in their lives, such as a mission, marriage, parenthood, or a new job. How did that preparation compare to the preparation needed to qualify for baptism, as described in Moroni 6:1–3? (see also Mosiah 18:8–10; D&amp;C 20:37). Why are the characteristics listed in these passages necessary for baptism? How do we know if we are prepared for this ordinance? Encourage class members to ponder how well they have been living up to these standards since their baptism and what they could do to improve. You could also invite them to write down any impressions they receive and to refer to them often.</li>
</ul>
<graphics-caption>Ordinances are performed by the power of the priesthood.</graphics-caption>
<heading>MORONI 4–5</heading>
<heading>Partaking of the sacrament helps us draw closer to Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>This week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families suggests study activities related to the sacrament. Perhaps you could invite a few class members to complete these activities at home and come to class prepared to share what they learned. You might also invite class members to share with each other what they do to prepare themselves and their families to have sacred experiences with the sacrament.</li>
<li>Most of us have heard the sacrament prayers many times, but do we think much about what the words mean? To help class members ponder these prayers, you could give them several minutes to write down the two sacrament prayers from memory. Then invite them to compare what they wrote with Moroni 4:3 and 5:2. What did they easily remember? What did they miss? Did they notice anything about these prayers that they hadn't noticed before? Invite class members to share words and phrases from the sacrament prayers that stand out to them or that help them feel the sacredness of this ordinance. To deepen class members' appreciation for the sacrament, consider inviting a class member to sing or play a sacrament hymn. You could also show the video "Always Remember Him" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORONI 6:4–9</heading>
<heading>Disciples of Jesus Christ minister to one another.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Consider using an analogy to help class members understand the importance of being "nourished by the good word of God" (Moroni 6:4). For example, what type of nourishment is needed for a seedling or a baby? What happens if you neglect something that needs nourishment? How are new and returning members of the Church similar to a plant or infant in need of nourishment? Class members could search Moroni 6:4–9 for ideas about how they can "nourish" each other spiritually. They could also find ideas in "Additional Resources." You might share an experience in which a fellow disciple ministered to you. Perhaps class members would be willing to share similar experiences.</li>
<li>Moroni 6:4–9 could help class members understand how we are blessed when we are "numbered among the people of the church of Christ" and attend church meetings. How could we explain these blessings to someone who questions the need for an organized church? Perhaps class members could search these verses to find something they could share. Or they could list some of the blessings they've received as members of the Church (see D. Todd Christofferson, "Why the Church," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 108–11). What can we do to ensure that our fellow disciples are "remembered and nourished by the good word of God" as we "meet together oft"? (Moroni 6:4–5).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>Class members may be more eager to read Moroni 7–9 next week if you explain that it includes two letters written by Mormon to help his son stay faithful in difficult times.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Nourished by the word of God.</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: "Most people don't come to church looking merely for a few new gospel facts or to see old friends, though all of that is important. They come seeking a spiritual experience. They want peace. They want their faith fortified and their hope renewed. They want, in short, to be nourished by the good word of God, to be strengthened by the powers of heaven" ("A Teacher Come from God," Ensign, May 1998, 26).</p>
<p>President Gordon B. Hinckley explained that nourishing converts with the word of God "is a work for everyone. It is a work for home teachers and visiting teachers [now ministering brothers and sisters]. It is a work for the bishopric, for the priesthood quorums, for the Relief Society, the young men and young women, even the Primary.
"I was in a fast and testimony meeting only last Sunday. A 15- or 16–year-old boy stood before the congregation and said that he had decided to be baptized.
"Then one by one, boys of the teachers quorum stepped to the microphone to express their love for him, to tell him that he was doing the right thing, and to assure him that they would stand with him and help him. It was a wonderful experience to hear those young men speak words of appreciation and encouragement to their friend. I am satisfied that all of those boys, including the one who was baptized last week, will go on missions.
"In a recent press interview I was asked, «What brings you the greatest satisfaction as you see the work of the Church today?»
"My response: «The most satisfying experience I have is to see what this gospel does for people. It gives them a new outlook on life. It gives them a perspective that they have never felt before. It raises their sights to things noble and divine. Something happens to them that is miraculous to behold. They look to Christ and come alive.»
"... I ask each of you to please help in this undertaking" ("Converts and Young Men," Ensign, May 1997, 48).</p>

<heading>MORONI 7:3–19</heading>
<heading>"That which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually."</heading>
<ul>
<li>In order to be disciples of Jesus Christ, we must be able to judge between good and evil. Perhaps discussing the truths in Moroni 7:3–19 could help class members avoid judging "wrongfully" (Moroni 7:18). To prepare for the discussion, half of the class could search these verses for counsel Mormon gives about how to identify what comes from God, and the other half could look for how to identify what comes from the devil. They could then discuss what they found and share examples of things that invite them "to do good, and to love God, and to serve him" (Moroni 7:13). How do we apply Mormon's counsel in our daily decisions? How can we make righteous choices and still show love for those around us who do not live the gospel?</li>
<li>Many people wonder, "How can I know if a prompting I have comes from God or from my own thoughts?" You could write this question on the board and invite class members to search Moroni 7:13–16 for principles that could help answer this question. How might these verses help us recognize divine inspiration? It may help to explain that "the Spirit of Christ," also known as the light of Christ, is sometimes referred to as our conscience. The statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley in "Additional Resources" and the video "Patterns of Light: Discerning Light" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) may also be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORONI 7:21–48</heading>
<heading>Followers of Jesus Christ seek faith, hope, and charity.</heading>
<ul>
<li>To help your class better understand the connections between faith, hope, and charity, you could show a three-legged stool (or a picture of one) and ask class members to consider how faith, hope, and charity are like these three legs (see President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's statement in "Additional Resources"). You could then invite them to choose one of these attributes and look for what Mormon teaches about it in Moroni 7:21–48. Discuss questions like the following: Why do we need faith and hope to receive the gift of charity? How do each of these attributes connect us to Jesus Christ? Why are these attributes essential for a disciple of Jesus Christ? What would happen to us if we lost faith? hope? charity? Invite class members to take a few moments to write impressions they've had.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORONI 8:4–21</heading>
<heading>Understanding correct doctrine can help us make correct choices.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Your class may not need to discuss why it's wrong to baptize infants, but Mormon's words on this topic can help them see the dangers of false doctrine in general. To illustrate how the Book of Mormon "[confounds] false doctrines" (2 Nephi 3:12), you could invite class members to read Moroni 8:4–21 in groups or individually. Half of them could look for doctrine that Mormon felt the people didn't understand, including the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see verse 20) and accountability (see verse 10). The other half could look for the consequences of the people's error. Each group could share with the class what they found. What do these verses teach us about the importance of learning and living by correct doctrine? Where can we find correct explanations of Christ's doctrine? How can we make sure our understanding of the doctrine is correct?</li>
<li>Maybe your class would benefit from following Mormon's example of helping someone make better choices by teaching them correct doctrine. You could do this by inviting class members to think of someone from the scriptures who made a wrong choice. What doctrinal truth would help that person avoid making that incorrect choice again? Give class members a few minutes to find scriptures or statements from a recent general conference that would help the person understand the doctrinal truth. You could then ask class members to share what they found.</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORONI 9:25–26</heading>
<heading>We can have hope in Christ regardless of our circumstances.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Mormon's last recorded message to his son in Moroni 9:25–26 can help class members find hope in Christ, even in seemingly hopeless situations. Perhaps you could begin by asking class members to share reasons Moroni might have felt discouraged. Then they could read these verses and list on the board the truths that Mormon encouraged Moroni to focus on. How can these same truths "lift [us] up" in our day? Class members could also share examples of God's "mercy and long-suffering" that they have witnessed. Or they could share ideas to help one another keep the Savior and His gospel "in [our] mind forever," even when we face discouragement (verse 25).</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To encourage class members to read Moroni 10, you could suggest that it may be an ideal time to reflect on how they have experienced a renewed witness of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon as they have studied it this year.</p>
<heading>Additional Resources</heading>
<heading>Does it come from the Spirit?</heading>
<p>To answer the question "How do we recognize the promptings of the Spirit?" President Gordon B. Hinckley quoted Moroni 7:13 and said: "I don't think [it's] too difficult, really. ... Does it persuade one to do good, to rise, to stand tall, to do the right thing, to be kind, to be generous? Then it is of the Spirit of God" (Teachings of Gordon B. Hinckley [1997], 260–61).</p>
<heading>Faith, hope, and charity.</heading>
<p>President Dieter F. Uchtdorf compared faith, hope, and charity to a stool with three legs, explaining that these three virtues "stabilize our lives regardless of the rough or uneven surfaces we might encounter. ...
"Faith, hope, and charity complement each other, and as one increases, the others grow as well. Hope comes of faith, for without faith, there is no hope. In like manner faith comes of hope, for faith is «the substance of things hoped for.»
"Hope is critical to both faith and charity. When disobedience, disappointment, and procrastination erode faith, hope is there to uphold our faith. When frustration and impatience challenge charity, hope braces our resolve and urges us to care for our fellowmen even without expectation of reward. The brighter our hope, the greater our faith. The stronger our hope, the purer our charity" ("The Infinite Power of Hope," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2008, 21, 23–24).</p>
<heading>"The pure love of Christ."</heading>
<p>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland suggested two possible meanings of the phrase "the pure love of Christ": "One ... is the kind of merciful, forgiving love Christ's disciples should have for one another. ...
"[Another meaning is] Christ's unfailing, ultimate, and atoning love for us. ... It is that charity — his pure love for us — without which we would be nothing" (Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 336).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>Help learners develop spiritual self-reliance.</b>"As you teach, rather than simply imparting information, help [class members] discover gospel truths for themselves. . . . When they have questions, sometimes it is better to teach them how to find answers themselves" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 28). For example, you could point members to Gospel Topics at topics.ChurchofJesusChrist.org, which contains helpful information on a variety of subjects.</p>

<p>You could invite class members to imagine that Moroni is visiting the class. What would they say to him about what he wrote in Moroni 10? Are there any verses that are especially meaningful to them? Perhaps they could share experiences they have had with these verses.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>
<heading>MORONI 10:3–7</heading>
<heading>I can know the truth by the power of the Holy Ghost.</heading>
<ul>
<li>Class members may gain new insights if they study Moroni 10:3–5 carefully. To help them, you could write important phrases from these verses on separate slips of paper and give one to each class member or to a group of class members. Invite them to ponder or discuss what their phrase means, including what they can do to apply it in their lives. Then you could read Moroni 10:3–5 together, stopping when you get to a phrase that someone studied so that the class member can share his or her thoughts.</li>
<li>To encourage class members to share experiences they have had with acting on Moroni's invitation in these verses, you could invite them to imagine they are trying to encourage a friend or family member to gain a testimony of the Book of Mormon. How might they use Moroni 10:3–7? What experiences could they share? How can we help others understand what it means to know something "by the power of the Holy Ghost"? (Moroni 10:5).</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORONI 10:8–25</heading>
<heading>"Deny not the gifts of God."</heading>
<ul>
<li>Why is the admonition to "deny not the gifts of God" particularly important in these latter days? (Moroni 10:8). Encourage class members to ponder this question as they read Moroni 10:8–18. To help strengthen class members' belief in spiritual gifts, you could invite them to share examples of people using each gift that is listed in Moroni 10:9–16. Examples could come from the scriptures, from Church history, or from their own lives. (Examples from the Book of Mormon are suggested in "Additional Resources.") You could also discuss how some of the gifts described in these verses were manifested in the coming forth of the Book of Mormon. Why is it important for someone who is seeking a testimony of the Book of Mormon to believe in spiritual gifts? What do we sometimes do to "deny" these gifts in our lives? How do these gifts help us "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him"? (see Moroni 10:30–33).</li>
<li>Another way to explore the spiritual gifts described in these verses is to write on the board questions like What are spiritual gifts? Who are they given to? Why are they given? and How do we receive them? Then invite class members to search Moroni 10:8–25 to find answers. (The statements by President Brigham Young and President Dallin H. Oaks in "Additional Resources" can also help.) In addition to the spiritual gifts listed in verses 9–16, what other "gifts of God" have we received or been blessed by? (Moroni 10:8). You may want to share what Elder Bruce R. McConkie taught: "Spiritual gifts are endless in number and infinite in variety. Those listed in the revealed word are simply illustrations of the boundless outpouring of divine grace that a gracious God gives those who love and serve him" (A New Witness for the Articles of Faith [1985], 371).</li>
</ul>
<heading>MORONI 10:30–33</heading>
<heading>I can be perfected through the grace of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>What do you feel would help the members of your class accept Moroni's invitation to "come unto Christ, and be perfected in him"? (Moroni 10:32). Perhaps beginning with a hymn on this subject, such as "Come, Follow Me" (Hymns, no. 116), could invite the Spirit into your discussion, and class members could share any connections they see between the hymn and the truths found in Moroni 10:30–33. What do we learn from these verses and this hymn about what it means to come unto Christ? What does it mean to be "perfect in Christ"? (see also D&amp;C 76:50–53, 69). Share your feelings about what it means to be "made perfect through Jesus" (D&amp;C 76:69), and encourage class members to share theirs.</li>
<li>Because this is your class's last discussion of the Book of Mormon this year, you may want to ask class members to share some of what they have felt and learned as they studied this book. To help class members do this, you could read Moroni 10:32–33 together and ask class members to spend a few minutes pondering how the Book of Mormon has helped them come unto Christ. You could ask: How has the Book of Mormon helped us have greater love for God? How has it helped us rely more completely on the grace of Christ? How has it helped us to "deny not" the Savior's power? Invite class members to bear their testimonies of the Book of Mormon and its witness of Jesus Christ.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To help class members look forward to studying the Doctrine and Covenants next year, you could review Moroni 10:9–16 and explain that these gifts are all evident in the Church today. As we read the Doctrine and Covenants, we will see how the gifts and power of God have been used to do His work in the latter days.</p>

Her prayers were answered in many ways, including the receipt of spiritual gifts. She had many, but the ones that stand out in my memory are the gifts of faith, testimony, and wisdom" ("Spiritual Gifts," Ensign, Sept. 1986, 72).</p>

<p><b>Reserve time for learners to share.</b>"When learners share what they are learning, they not only feel the Spirit and strengthen their own testimonies, but they also encourage other class members to discover truths for themselves" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 30).</p>

<p>As you study the birth of Jesus Christ this week, consider how you can help your class strengthen their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His Atonement. Some of the ideas in this outline can help.</p>
<heading>Invite Sharing</heading>
<p>Invite class members to form pairs or small groups and share how learning about Jesus Christ from the Book of Mormon this year has strengthened their faith in Him and His teachings.</p>
<heading>Teach the Doctrine</heading>

<heading>Jesus Christ was born to be our Savior.</heading>
<ul>
<li>How can you use the Book of Mormon to teach class members about the sacred event of the Savior's birth? One way is to divide the class into three groups and give each group one of the following scripture passages to read together: 1 Nephi 11:13–23; Helaman 14:1–13; and 3 Nephi 1:4–22. Ask the groups to discuss what these scriptures teach them about the birth of the Savior. Then each group could share with the rest of the class what they discussed. Why is it valuable to have the Book of Mormon's witness of the Savior's birth?</li>
<li>Knowing about the birth of Christ is important, but knowing why He was born is vital. How can you help those you teach ponder the redeeming power of Jesus Christ? Perhaps class members could share some of the stories and passages they studied this week (see this week's outline in Come, Follow Me—For Individuals and Families). Encourage them to share how the things they studied deepened their appreciation of the Savior's birth and of His redeeming power.</li>
<li>To start a discussion about the gifts God has given us through His Son, you could invite a few class members to talk about special gifts they have received at Christmas. How do we show gratitude for the gifts we receive? Class members could then read the quote by President Thomas S. Monson found in "Additional Resources" and discuss the four gifts President Monson mentioned. What role does the Savior play in these gifts? How can we show our gratitude to Heavenly Father for these gifts?</li>
<li>As part of your discussion about Christmas, consider inviting class members to play or sing Christmas hymns. You could also explore some of the resources listed in "Additional Resources."</li>

<heading>The Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ.</heading>
<ul>
<li>As your study of the Book of Mormon in Sunday School comes to a close, you might want to give class members an opportunity to reflect on what they have learned about Jesus Christ in the Book of Mormon this year. To help start a discussion, you could read together 2 Nephi 25:23, 26 and 33:4, 10, as well as excerpts from the Book of Mormon's introduction and title page. You could also share a story or passage that has brought you closer to Jesus Christ and then give class members a few minutes to share their own stories or passages. Bear your testimony of the Book of Mormon, and invite other class members to do the same.</li>
</ul>
<heading>Encourage Learning at Home</heading>
<p>To inspire class members to begin reading the Doctrine and Covenants, you could share a favorite verse or an inspiring experience you've had with studying the Doctrine and Covenants.</p>

<heading>The gifts of the Savior.</heading>
<p>President Thomas S. Monson taught:
"I reflect on the contrasts of Christmas. The extravagant gifts, expensively packaged and professionally wrapped, reach their zenith in the famed commercial catalogs carrying the headline «For the person who has everything.» In one such reading I observed a four-thousand-square-foot home wrapped with a gigantic ribbon and comparable greeting card which said, «Merry Christmas.» Other items included diamond-studded clubs for the golfer, a Caribbean cruise for the traveler, and a luxury trip to the Swiss Alps for the adventurer. Such seemed to fit the theme of a Christmas cartoon which showed the Three Wise Men traveling to Bethlehem with gift boxes on their camels. One says, «Mark my words, Balthazar, we're starting something with these gifts that's going to get way out of hand!» ... 
"For a few moments, may we set aside the catalogs of Christmas, with their gifts of exotic description. Let's even turn from the flowers for Mother, the special tie for Father, the cute doll, the train that whistles, the long-awaited bicycle ... and direct our thoughts to those God-given gifts that endure. I have chosen from a long list just four: ... 
"First,<b>the gift of birth.</b>It has been universally bestowed on each of us. Ours was the divine privilege to depart our heavenly home to tabernacle in the flesh and to demonstrate by our lives our worthiness and qualifications to one day return to Him, precious loved ones, and a kingdom called celestial. ... Ours is the responsibility to show our gratitude by the actions of our lives. ...
"Second,<b>the gift of peace.</b>In the raucous world in which we live, the din of traffic, the blaring commercials of the media, and the sheer demands placed on our time to say nothing of the problems of the world — cause headache, inflict pain, and sap our strength to cope. ...
"He who was burdened with sorrow and acquainted with grief speaks to every troubled heart and bestows the gift of peace. «Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid» (John 14:27). ... 
"Third,<b>the gift of love.</b>'Master, which is the great commandment in the law?' queried the lawyer who spoke to Jesus. Came the prompt reply: «Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
"This is the first and great commandment.
"And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself» (Matthew 22:36–39). ...
"Fourth,<b>the gift of life</b>— even immortality. Our Heavenly Father's plan contains the ultimate expressions of true love. All that we hold dear, even our families, our friends, our joy, our knowledge, our testimonies, would vanish were it not for our Father and His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Among the most cherished thoughts and writings in this world is the divine statement of truth: «For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life» (John 3:16)" ("Gifts," Ensign, May 1993, 59–62).</p>
<heading>Improving Our Teaching</heading>
<p><b>It's OK to say, "I don't know."</b>While you should do your best to answer any questions that your class members have about the gospel, the Lord doesn't expect you to know everything. When you don't know how to answer something, consider responding by inviting the class to search together for an answer in the scriptures and share what they find. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 24.)</p>
