<heading type="ref"> 2 Nephi 26&#8211;30 </heading>
<heading type="title"> "A MARVELOUS WORK AND A WONDER" </heading>
<p> Remember that the home should be the center of gospel learning. Your personal and family study of 2 Nephi 26&#8211;30 should be the basis of your preparation to teach. Plan ways to build upon, reinforce, and encourage the personal and family study of the people in your class. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> At the beginning of the lesson, give class members a chance to share something from 2 Nephi 26&#8211;30 that they found meaningful as they studied at home. For example, you could ask them to briefly share a verse that helped them understand our day and the challenges we face. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 26:24&#8211;28, 33 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Everything the Lord does is motivated by His love for us. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> If you feel inspired to discuss Nephi's teachings about the Lord's love, you could try this: After reading 2 Nephi 26:24 together, invite class members to make lists of things that Jesus Christ has done for them that were motivated by love. How does He "draw all men unto him"? What do we feel ins to do in response to His expressions of love? </p>
<p type="bullet"> The Lord's invitations in 2 Nephi 26:24&#8211;28, 33 are powerful evidence of His love. One way you might help class members discover these invitations is to ask them to condense the Lord's message in these verses into a one-sentence summary. Perhaps a few class members would be willing to share their summaries. How might these verses influence the way we invite others to come unto Christ? Encourage the class to record some of their thoughts and feelings. To help invite the Spirit, consider playing a recording of a hymn about the Savior's love, such as "Come unto Jesus" (Hymns, no. 117), while class members are pondering. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 27; 29; 30:3&#8211;8 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Book of Mormon is essential to God's latter-day work. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> People in your class may need a little help understanding the prophecy in 2 Nephi 27 about a sealed book and a learned man. The historical account in "Additional Resources" might help. Would it work for your class if a few class members briefly dramatized the events described in this account and in 2 Nephi 27:15&#8211;22? Why might Nephi have been shown these events so many years in advance? What does Nephi's prophecy teach us about the importance of the Book of Mormon? Encourage class members to share with each other how they gained their own testimonies of the Book of Mormon. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Has anyone in your class had an experience with inviting someone to read the Book of Mormon that they could share? What are some reasons someone might not accept an invitation to read the Book of Mormon? The Lord's response to one such reason is found in 2 Nephi 29:6&#8211;11. You could invite class members to read these verses and then role-play how they might lovingly respond to someone who says that the Book of Mormon is not necessary. What other ideas do class members have about how they can help others "know that [the Book of Mormon] is a blessing unto them from the hand of God"? (2 Nephi 30:6). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 28 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Satan seeks to deceive. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> This week's outline in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families suggests searching for Satan's lies described in 2 Nephi 28. Perhaps class members could share what they found, or they could scan 2 Nephi 28 in class and list Satan's lies that they identify. It might also be helpful to let them work in small groups to find scriptures that refute these deceptions (if they need help, you could share the suggestions in "Additional Resources"). Then the groups could share with each other what they found and discuss how they can detect the adversary's "false and vain and foolish doctrines" (2 Nephi 28:9). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Encourage Learning at Home </heading>
<p> Class members might be inspired to read 2 Nephi 31&#8211;33 if they know that these chapters contain Nephi's last recorded words, including one of the simplest yet most comprehensive descriptions of the doctrine of Christ. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Then shall the learned say: I cannot read it" (2 Nephi 27:18). </subheading>
<p> In February 1828, Martin Harris, a friend of Joseph Smith, took a "journey east to New York City with a transcription of some of the characters on the [golden] plates to show them to scholars. Perhaps he wanted additional reassurance that the plates were authentic, or he may have thought a testimonial would help them borrow money to publish the translation. In any event, he insisted that the Lord had prompted him to make the trip. </p>
<p> "At the time, neither Joseph nor Martin knew much about the language on the plates. They knew only as much as the angel Moroni had told Joseph: that it was an ancient American record. Thus, rather than seeking a scholar with a knowledge of Egyptian (Joseph later learned that the language on the plates was called 'reformed Egyptian'), Martin visited several scholars with an interest in antiquities, especially American antiquities. </p>
<p> ". . . [Among the scholars Martin visited was] Charles Anthon, a young professor of grammar and linguistics at Columbia College. Anthon had been collecting American Indian stories and speeches for publication and was eager to inspect the document Martin brought him. </p>
<p> "Martin claimed that Anthon declared the characters authentic until he learned how Joseph Smith had acquired them. He suggested Martin bring him the plates. Martin refused, and Anthon replied, paraphrasing a verse in Isaiah, 'I cannot read a sealed book.' Though Anthon later denied the details of Martin's account of their meeting, we do know this: Martin came away from his visits with the eastern scholars more convinced than ever that Joseph Smith was called of God and that the plates and characters were ancient. He and Joseph viewed the visit to Anthon as a fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy (also mentioned in the Book of Mormon itself) of 'a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it is sealed' [Isaiah 29:11; see also 2 Nephi 27:15&#8211;18]" ("The Contributions of Martin Harris," Revelations in Context [2016], 3&#8211;4, history.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). </p>

<p> <b> Don't be afraid of silence. </b> "Good questions take time to answer. They require pondering, searching, and inspiration. The time you spend waiting for answers to a question can be a sacred time of pondering. Avoid the temptation to end this time too soon by answering your own question or moving on to something else" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 31). </p>

<heading type="title"> "THIS IS THE WAY" </heading>
<p> As you study 2 Nephi 31&#8211;33, keep the members of your class in mind and consider what experiences they may have had with the truths Nephi taught. How can you invite them to teach each other what they have learned and felt about these doctrines? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Did anyone in class have a meaningful experience this week with one of the study suggestions in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families? Give class members the opportunity to share their experiences. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 31&#8211;32 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Jesus Christ and His doctrine are the only way to eternal life. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Perhaps it would benefit your class to see how faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end relate to each other and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. To do this, you could draw a path on the board and invite class members to write along the path some of the principles found in 2 Nephi 31. Each class member could select one of these principles and search 2 Nephi 31&#8211;32 to find something that Nephi taught about it. Then they could share with each other what they found and discuss how it helps them understand the principles better. How does living these principles bring the blessings of the Atonement of Jesus Christ into our lives? </p>
<p type="bullet"> How might you begin a discussion on Nephi's plain and simple description of "the way" to salvation? (2 Nephi 31:21). Perhaps you could ask class members what they would say if they only had 60 seconds to explain what a person mu do to receive salvation. Then class members could scan 2 Nephi 31&#8211;32, looking for statements that could help. What do we learn from these chapters about the Savior's central role in our salvation? The statements in "Additional Resources" could be helpful to this conversation. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Sometimes we see gospel principles as distinct and separate, but in reality they are interrelated. To help class members see how the principles in 2 Nephi 31 are connected, invite class members, individually or in small groups, to read verses 4&#8211;21 and create a diagram that shows how faith in Christ, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end build on each other, relate to each other, and so on. Encourage them to be creative. As they share their diagrams with the class, ask them to share what they learned about these principles. How can we make them part of our daily lives? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 31:15&#8211;20 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved." </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Do class members understand what it means to endure to the end? Here's an activity that can help. Write on the board <i> How do I know if I am enduring to the end? </i> Then invite class members to search 2 Nephi 31:15&#8211;20 to find possible answers to this question. Ask class members to write on the board any helpful words or phrases they find. Why is enduring to the end an essential part of the doctrine of Christ? You could also share Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf's statement in "Additional Resources" or the statement about enduring to the end on page 6 of <i> Preach My Gospel. </i> </p>
<p type="bullet"> Do class members know anyone who is an example of enduring to the end? What has helped this person "press forward with a steadfastness in Christ"? (verse 20). Consider sharing stories of other people mentioned in the scriptures who endured to the end. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 32:1&#8211;6 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Holy Ghost will show us what we should do. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> In 2 Nephi 32, Nephi addressed a concern he perceived his people had about applying the doctrine of Christ. You could invite class members to look for this concern in 2 Nephi 32:1 and then read Nephi's answer in 2 Nephi 32:2&#8211;6. How would class members restate in their own words what Nephi taught? What experiences have class members had when the Holy Ghost or the words of Christ have shown them what they needed to do? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> 2 NEPHI 33 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Book of Mormon persuades us to believe in Christ. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Nephi hoped that his words would persuade us "to do good [and] to believe in [Christ]" (2 Nephi 33:4). What passages or stories from 1 and 2 Nephi have persuaded us to do good and believe in Christ? Consider finding some hymns your class could sing or listen to that reinforce these messages, such as "I Believe in Christ" or "Have I Done Any Good?" (Hymns, nos. 134, 223). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Encourage Learning at Home </heading>
<p> One way to inspire class members to study Jacob 1&#8211;4 next week is to explain that in these chapters they will find Jacob's warnings about two sins that are particularly prevalent in our day. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The doctrine of Christ. </subheading>
<p> Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: "The 'doctrine of Christ' as taught by Nephi in his grand, summational discourse focuses on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism by immersion, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end. It does not, in this declaration, attempt to cover the entire plan of salvation, all the virtues of a Christian life, or the rewards that await us in differing degrees of heavenly glory. It does not, in this declaration, deal with the offices of the priesthood, the ordinances of the temple, or many other true doctrines. All these are important, but as used in the Book of Mormon, 'the doctrine of Christ' is simple and direct. It focuses on the first principles of the gospel exclusively, including an expression of encouragement to endure, to persist, to press on. Indeed, it is in the clarity and simplicity of 'the doctrine of Christ' that its impact is found" (Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 49&#8211;50). </p>
<p> Elder D. Todd Christofferson said: "I appeal to all. . . to seek through prayer and study of the scriptures [a] witness of the divine character, the Atonement, and the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Accept His doctrine by repenting, being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and then throughout your life following the laws and covenants of the gospel of Jesus Christ" ("The Doctrine of Christ," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 89). </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Enduring to the end. </subheading>
<p> Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf explained: </p>
<p> "When I was a young boy, 'endure to the end' meant to me mainly that I had to try harder to stay awake until the end of our Church meetings. Later as a teenager . . . I linked it with youthful empathy to the efforts of our dear elderly members to hang in there until the end of their lives. . . . </p>
<p> ". . . Enduring to the end is not just a matter of passively tolerating life's difficult circumstances or 'hanging in there.' Ours is an active religion, helping God's children along the strait and narrow path to develop their full potential during this life and return to Him one day. Viewed from this perspective, enduring to the end is exalting and glorious, not grim and gloomy. This is a joyful religion, one of hope, strength, and deliverance. . . </p>
<p> "Enduring to the end implies 'patient continuance in well doing' (Romans 2:7), striving to keep the commandments (see 2 Nephi 31:10), and doing the works of righteousness (see D&amp;C 59:23)" ("Have We Not Reason to Rejoice?" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 20). </p>

<heading type="ref"> Jacob 1&#8211;4 </heading>
<heading type="title"> BE RECONCILED UNTO GOD THROUGH THE ATONEMENT OF CHRIST </heading>
<p> Jacob 1&#8211;4 contains many teachings that apply to our day. As you read these chapters, consider how you can help those you teach live the doctrine Jacob taught. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> To help class members share insights from Jacob 1&#8211;4, you could pass out slips of paper and invite class members to write a scripture reference from these chapters that they found meaningful. Put the slips into a container, draw out a few, and invite the people who wrote the references to share their insights. </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Teach the Doctrine JACOB 1:6&#8211;8, 15&#8211;19; 2:1&#8211;11; 4:18 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Righteous leaders labor diligently for the welfare of souls. </subheading>
<p> You might begin a discussion about Jacob's diligent labors among his people by asking class members to share experiences when they were blessed by the service of a Church leader. Or consider asking a local Church leader &#8212; past or present to talk about a time when he or she felt inspired to serve someone. Class members could then find words and phrases in Jacob 1:6&#8211;8, 15&#8211;19; 2:1&#8211;11; and 4:18 that help us understand how Jacob felt about his calling and the people he served. How have we seen our leaders magnify their callings? What do these verses suggest about the way we should sustain our leaders? </p>
<graphics-caption> Like Jacob, Church leaders today "magnify [their] office unto the Lord." </graphics-caption>
<subheading type="ref"> JACOB 2:12&#8211;21 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We should avoid pride and reach out to those in need. </subheading>
<p> The Lord had strong warnings for the Nephites about pride. To help begin a discussion on this topic, you could contact a few class members in advance and ask them to look for ways the adversary promotes the love of riches in our world today. Then invite them to share with the class what they noticed. Class members could work in pairs to read Jacob 2:12&#8211;21 and find what the Lord taught about how we should view material wealth. They could then create and share a poster that promotes that principle. Provide time for class members to ponder individually what they can do to apply what they learn from Jacob's message. </p>
<p> Your class members could review Jacob 2:12&#8211;21 and write their own questions to add to Elder Perry's list in "Additional Resources." What does Elder Perry's statement add to our understanding of Jacob's teachings? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> JACOB 2:23&#8211;35 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord delights in chastity. </subheading>
<p> Elder David A. Bednar taught that we live "in a world that increasingly mocks the sanctity of procreation and minimizes the worth of human life" ("We Believe in Being Chaste," Ensign or Liahona, May 2013, 41&#8211;44). How might you help class members use Jacob 2:23&#8211;35 to counteract the world's messages about chastity? One way might be to write on the board <i> How does the Lord feel about chastity? </i> and invite class members to find answers to the question. Some of them could search Jacob 2:23&#8211;35, and the others could search Elder Bednar's talk referenced above. They could list on the board the answers they find. To discuss standards and blessings associated with living the law of chastity, you might review "Sexual Purity" (For the Strength of Youth, 35&#8211;37) or show one of the videos listed in "Additional Resources." What are the blessings of living a chaste life? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> JACOB 4:4&#8211;11 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Nephites believed in Jesus Christ. </subheading>
<p> Jacob wanted us to know that even though he and his people lived hundreds of years before the Savior's mortal ministry, they knew of Him and looked to Him for salvation. According to Jacob 4:4&#8211;5, why did the Nephites keep the law of Moses? What do we have in our day that points our souls to the Savior? What symbols or similitudes did Jacob use to teach about Jesus Christ? (see also Genesis 22:1&#8211;13). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> JACOB 4:8&#8211;18 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> I can avoid spiritual blindness by focusing on the Savior. </subheading>
<p> Has anyone in your class recently had an eye exam? If so, you might ask this person to describe how the doctor assessed his or her vision. Class members could share what they think it means to be spiritually blind. How is spiritual blindness similar to physical blindness? Invite class members to suggest ways we can assess whether we are spiritually blind. They could also review Jacob 4:8&#8211;18 and suggest some things we can do to increase our ability to "see" spiritual things. </p>
<p> Elder Quentin L. Cook outlined four ways people might look "beyond the mark" in our day (see "Additional Resources"). What do his words add to our understanding of Jacob 4:13&#8211;15? What does it mean to look beyond the mark? How can we avoid looking beyond the mark? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Encourage Learning at Home </heading>
<p> To inspire class members to read Jacob 5&#8211;7, tell them that they will find the answer to the question in Jacob 4:17 as they prayerfully read the next three chapters. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Our attitudes toward material wealth. </subheading>
<p> Referring to Jacob 2:13&#8211;19, Elder L. Tom Perry taught: "We need to take Jacob's counsel to heart. </p>
<p> We should read this scripture as though it were written expressly for us in these days, because it was. His words should cause us to ask soul-searching questions of ourselves. Is the order of things right in our own lives? Are we investing, first and foremost, in the things that are eternal in nature? Do we have an eternal perspective? Or have we fallen into the trap of investing in the things of this world first and then forgetting the Lord?" ("United in Building the Kingdom of God," Ensign, May 1987, 34). </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Videos about chastity (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> "I Choose to Be Pure" </p>
<p type="bullet"> "Chastity: What Are the Limits?" </p>
<p type="bullet"> "Law of Chastity" </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Looking beyond the mark. </subheading>
<p> Elder Quentin L. Cook taught how we might look "beyond the mark": </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Substituting the philosophies of men for gospel truths" </subheading>
<p> "Some people seem to be embarrassed by the simplicity of the Savior's message. They want to add complexity and even obscurity to the truth to make it more intellectually challenging or more compatible with current academic trends. . . . We look beyond the mark when we refuse to accept simple gospel truths for what they are." </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Gospel extremism" </subheading>
<p> "We are looking beyond the mark when we elevate any one principle, no matter how worthwhile it may be, to a prominence that lessens our commitment to other equally important principles or when we take a position that is contrary to the teachings of the Brethren." </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Heroic gestures as a substitute for daily consecration" </subheading>
<p> "Some members profess that they would commit themselves with enthusiasm if given some great calling, but they do not find home teaching or visiting teaching [now called ministering] worthy of or sufficiently heroic for their sustained effort." </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Elevating rules over doctrine" </subheading>
<p> "Those who are committed to following rules without reference to doctrine and principle are particularly susceptible to looking beyond the mark" ("Looking beyond the Mark," Ensign or Liahona, Mar. 2003, 42&#8211;44). </p>
