<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading> You Are a Teacher in the Church of Jesus Christ </heading>
<p> You have been called of God to teach His children in the Savior's way. You were set apart to this calling by the authority of His holy priesthood. Even if you are not an experienced teacher, as you live worthily, pray daily, and study the scriptures, Heavenly Father will grant you the influence and power of the Holy Ghost to help you succeed (see 2 Nephi 33:1). </p>
<p> Those entrusted to your care are Heavenly Father's children, and He knows what they need and how best to reach them. Through the Holy Ghost, God will guide you as you prepare and while you are teaching. He will reveal to you what you should say and what you should do (see 2 Nephi 32:5). </p>
<p> The essential purpose of gospel teaching and learning is to deepen conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Your goal as a teacher is to help those you teach do all they can to become more converted &#8212; an effort that extends far beyond class time. Invite those you teach to actively participate in learning about Jesus Christ and His gospel and to act on what they learn. Encourage them to make their individual and family study outside of class the primary source of their gospel learning. As they act in faith by studying as individuals and families, they will invite the Spirit into their lives, and it is the Spirit that brings about true conversion. Everything you do as a teacher should point to this sacred objective. </p>
<p> Teach only the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ as found in the scriptures and the words of latter-day prophets. Pure doctrine &#8212; eternal, unchanging truth taught by God and His servants &#8212; invites the Spirit and has the power to change lives. </p>
<p> The calling to teach is a sacred trust, and it is normal to feel overwhelmed at times. But remember that your Heavenly Father called you, and He will never forsake you. This is the Lord's work, and as you serve "with all your heart, might, mind and strength" (Doctrine and Covenants 4:2), He will enlarge your capacities, gifts, and talents, and your service will bless the lives of those you teach. </p>

<heading> Using Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Sunday School </heading>
<heading> Preparing to Teach in Sunday School </heading>
<p> Personal and family study at home should be the center of gospel learning. This is true for you and for those you teach. As you prepare to teach, start by having your own experiences in the scriptures. Your most important preparation will occur as you search the scriptures and seek the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. </p>
<i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> is an important part of both your personal study and your preparation to teach. It will help you gain a deeper understanding of the doctrinal principles found in the scriptures. It will also enable you to inspire and invite class members to use <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> to enhance their personal and family scripture study (for help doing this, see "Ideas for Encouraging Personal and Family Study" in this resource). As you do, remember to be sensitive to class members whose family circumstances may not support regular family scripture study and family home evening. 
<p> During your preparation, thoughts and impressions will come to you about the people you teach, how the principles in the scriptures will bless their lives, and how you can inspire them to discover those principles as they study the scriptures for themselves. </p>
<heading> Teaching Ideas </heading>
<p> As you prepare to teach, you might gain additional inspiration by exploring the teaching outlines in this resource. Think of these ideas not as step-by-step instructions but rather as suggestions to spark your own inspiration. You know your class members, and you will get to know them even better as you learn together in class. The Lord knows them too, and He will inspire you with the best ways to help class members build on the gospel learning they are doing at home. </p>
<p> Many other resources are available for you to use as you prepare, including ideas in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> and Church magazines. For more information about these and other resources, see the section titled "Additional Resources" in this resource. </p>
<heading> Some Things to Keep in Mind </heading>
<p type="bullet"> Gospel learning is most effective when it is centered in the home. As a teacher, you have an important responsibility to support, encourage, and build upon class members' gospel learning at home. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Class members' conversion to Jesus Christ and His gospel will deepen as they understand and apply true doctrine. Encourage them to record and act on the impressions they receive from the Holy Ghost. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Teaching is more than lecturing, but it is also more than simply leading a discussion. Part of your role is to encourage participation that edifies and is based on the scriptures. You should also share the inspired insights you received as you studied the scriptures. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Remember that many class members are having meaningful experiences studying at home the same scriptures that you will be discussing in class. You can support their scripture study by providing them with frequent opportunities to share what they are learning at home. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Heavenly Father wants you to succeed as a teacher. He has provided many resources to help you, including teacher council meetings. In these meetings you can counsel with other teachers about challenges you face. You can also discuss and practice principles of Christlike teaching. </p>
<p type="bullet"> People learn best when they have opportunities to teach. On occasion, consider allowing class members, including youth, to teach a part of the lesson. Base this decision on the needs and abilities of class members. If you do invite a class member to teach, take the time to help him or her prepare in advance by using the ideas found in this resource and in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> . Remember that as the called teacher, you are ultimately responsible for what is taught in class. </p>
<p> This resource includes teaching outlines for every week of the year. On Sundays when Sunday School is not held, class members continue reading the Old Testament at home according to the schedule outlined in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> . When Sunday School is held, you may choose to either skip or combine lessons. </p>
</chapter>
<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading> Ideas for Encouraging Personal and Family Study </heading>
<p> Here are some ideas to help you encourage class members to study the word of God at home, both individually and as families. Be sensitive to the fact that not all class members can study the scriptures with their families (for example, some members live alone or in part-member families). </p>
<p type="bullet"> Invite class members to share experiences they had studying the scriptures at home. For example, you could ask them to share a verse that impressed them and to explain why they found it meaningful. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Ask class members to give examples of what they are doing to make personal or family scripture study more meaningful. (Some ideas can be found under "Ideas to Improve Your Personal Scripture Study" and "Ideas to Improve Your Family Scripture Study" in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> .) </p>
<p type="bullet"> Invite class members to share how they acted on impressions they received during their personal or family scripture study. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Spend a few minutes showing class members some of the resources provided by the Church to help members study the gospel. These resources include the scripture study helps found at scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; "Scripture Stories" found at children.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; teaching outlines and other resources in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Primary; </i> youth-focused content at youth.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; seminary and institute manuals; and videos, audio recordings, and images found at MediaLibrary.ChurchofJesusChrist.org. Many of these are also in the Gospel Library app. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Spend a few minutes explaining how to use the Gospel Library app to study the scriptures, including how to mark verses and record impressions. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Invite one or more class members to share how they have taught a specific gospel principle in their families. </p>

</chapter>
<chapter type="teacher-help">
<heading> A Pattern for Teaching </heading>
<p> Each outline in this resource follows a pattern of inviting, sharing, and teaching the doctrine. </p>
<heading> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> As part of every class, invite class members to share insights and experiences they had during the previous week as they studied the scriptures as individuals and families and applied what they learned. Help class members see that their personal learning outside of class is important. Their individual conversion to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will come not only through Sunday learning but also through their daily experiences. When class members hear each other's experiences and testimonies of Jesus Christ and His gospel, they are more likely to seek similar experiences of their own. </p>
<p> Not everyone will have read the chapters for each lesson, and even some who did may not feel comfortable sharing. Make sure all class members feel they are a valued part of the class, whether or not they have something to share. </p>
<heading> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<p> You and your class members should focus on Jesus Christ and His doctrine &#8212; the eternal truths of the gospel &#8212; found in the assigned scripture passages. As you discuss doctrine from the scriptures, what verses, quotations, experiences, questions, and additional resources might you share? How might you use these resources to help class members discover and understand gospel principles? How can you help them build their faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? </p>

<heading type="title"> "THIS IS MY WORK AND MY GLORY" </heading>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Members of your class may have had some wonderful experiences reading Moses 1 and Abraham 3 at home. How will you give class members opportunities to share those experiences? It may be as simple as asking questions like these: What impressed you as you read the scriptures this week? What surprised you? What made you stop and think? What helped you feel closer to your Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> MOSES 1:1&#8211;10, 37&#8211;39; ABRAHAM 3:22&#8211;26 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> As children of God, we have a divine destiny. </subheading>
<p> The truths revealed in Mose's and Abraham's visions can have a powerful influence on our choices and on our ability to overcome life's challenges. How can you help members of your class discover theses truths in Moses 1 and Abraham 3? One idea is to divide the class into groups and assign each group one of the following passages: </p>
<p> Moses 1:1&#8211;10; Moses 1:37&#8211;39; Abraham 3:22&#8211;26. </p>
<p> Each group could look for answers to questions such as "Who am I?" "Why am I here?" and "Who does God want me to become?" After sufficient time, the groups could then share their answers. How can these answers influence our daily actions? </p>

<subheading type="ref"> MOSES 1:12&#8211;23 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We can resist Satan's influence. </subheading>
<p> Moses's confrontation with Satan, found in Moses 1:12&#8211;23, holds lessons that could help your class members as they face temptation or deception from the adversary. What can we learn from Moses's response? The video "I Am a Son of God" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) can help class members discuss one of Satan's tactics &#8212; tempting us to doubt our spiritual experiences (see also "Additional Resources"). It might be meaningful if class members shared ideas and encouragement to help each other detect and resist Satan's efforts. </p>
<p> One lesson from Moses's experience is that Satan tempts us with counterfeits of God's truth and power. To help class members visualize this, you could bring to class some objects that are fake versions of other things, such as an artificial plant or a baby doll. How can we tell that these are fake? What are some of the counterfeits Satan uses today to tempt us? How can we recognize and reject them? (To learn how Moses did this, see Moses 1:13&#8211;18.) How does the Lord help us in our efforts? (see Moses 1:24&#8211;26). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ABRAHAM 3:22&#8211;28 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> This life is our opportunity to show that we will do what God commands. </subheading>
<p> How can you help class members see their lives as an opportunity to prove their faithfulness to God's commands? You might start by asking them to talk about experiences when they had to demonstrate proficiency in a skill &#8212; for example, in school, at work, or on an athletic team. They could talk about what they were required to do to prove themselves. How are these experiences similar to what is described in Abraham 3:24&#8211;26? How are they different? How do we include Heavenly Father and the Savior in our efforts to "prove" ourselves? (Abraham 3:25). How does knowing that we are here to prove ourselves obedient affect the way we respond to life's challenges? </p>
<p> What else do we learn from Abraham 3:22&#8211;28 about the premortal life, or our "first estate"? (verse 26). Why are these truths valuable to us? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Don't doubt what has been revealed to you. </subheading>
<p> Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught this about Moses's experience in Moses 1: "Moses' message to you today is: Don't let your guard down. Don't assume that a great revelation, some marvelous, illuminating moment, the opening of an inspired path, is the end of it. . . . Once there has been illumination, beware the temptation to retreat from a good thing. If it was right when you prayed about it and trusted it and lived for it, it is right now. Don't give up when the pressure mounts. Certainly don't give in to that being who is bent on the destruction of your happiness. Face your doubts. Master your fears. 'Cast not away therefore your confidence' [Hebrews 10:35]. </p>
<p> "Stay the course and see the beauty of life unfold for you" ("Cast Not Away Therefore Your Confidence," Ensign, Mar. 2000, 7, 9). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Help learners discover truths in the scriptures. </b> Before inviting class members to read a scripture passage, you might give them something specific to look for or consider. For example, they could look for something they learn about the Savior or something they would like to share with a family member. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 21.) </p>

<heading type="title"> "IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH" </heading>
<p> In order to prepare to teach, first read and ponder Genesis 1&#8211;2; Moses 2&#8211;3; and Abraham 4&#8211;5, and record your spiritual impressions. Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families and the ideas below can help you understand and teach the doctrine in these chapters. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> God repeatedly declared that the things He made during the Creation were "good" (see Moses 2:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25, 31). Invite class members to share good things they found as they read the scriptures at home this week. What was good about the things they discovered? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Genesis 1; Moses 2; Abraham 4 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "God created the heaven and the earth." </subheading>
<p> Class members may have noticed similarities and differences among the accounts of the Creation in the books of Genesis, Moses, and Abraham. Encourage class members to share what Joseph Smith's translation in Moses 2 adds to our understanding of the Creation account in Genesis 1. What additional insights do we gain from Abraham 4? To allow more people to share, you could encourage the class to do this comparison in pairs or small groups. (Some of the verses that have important differences are noted in "Additional Resources.") How do we benefit from having multiple accounts? What do these accounts suggest about what God wants us to know about the Creation? </p>
<p> When God created Adam and Eve, He gave them dominion over the earth and His other creations on it (see Genesis 1:28; Moses 2:28; Abraham 4:28). How do Doctrine and Covenants 59:16&#8211;21 and 104:13&#8211;18 help us better understand what it means to exercise righteous dominion over the earth? </p>
<p> A few days before class, you might invite class members to bring pictures they have taken or have in their homes that remind them of the beauty of God's creations. How does learning about the Lord's creative work affect our feelings about Him, ourselves, and the world? Class members could also share what messages they feel God has for us in these accounts of the Creation in Genesis 1; </p>
<p> Moses 2; and Abraham 4. Singing or listening to a song about the Creation, such as "For the Beauty of the Earth" (Hymns, no. 92) could help class members feel gratitude for God's creations. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> We are created in the image of God. </subheading>
<p> Why is it important for us to understand that </p>
<p> we are created in the image of God? How can you help class members ponder this truth? They could read Genesis 1:26&#8211;28; Moses 2:26&#8211;28; </p>
<p> Abraham 4:26&#8211;28; or the second paragraph of "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). How does this truth affect the way we see ourselves, others, and God? </p>
<p> Class members could find further insights in hymns such as "O My Father" or "I Am a Child of God" (Hymns, nos. 292, 301). </p>
<p> In the video "God's Greatest Creation" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org), President Russell M. Nelson bears testimony of the miraculous human body (see also "Thanks Be to God," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 77&#8211;80). Consider sharing this video before reading Genesis 1:26&#8211;28; Moses 2:26&#8211;28; or Abraham 4:26&#8211;28 as a class. How does President Nelson's testimony deepen our gratitude for the truths in these verses? </p>

<p> Many views on marriage in the world today diverge from eternal truth. To help your class learn about God's views on marriage, you might invite them to read Genesis 1:27&#8211;28; Moses 3:18, 21&#8211;25; or Abraham 5:14&#8211;19 and to list on the board the truths they find. They could add to their list truths they find in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Why are these truths valuable to us? </p>

<p> As you prepare to teach about Genesis 3&#8211;4 and Moses 4&#8211;5, think about what questions or activities might help class members better understand the Fall of Adam and Eve. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Class members could briefly review Genesis 3&#8211;4 or Moses 4&#8211;5, select a verse that stands out to them, and share it with someone sitting nearby. Then a few people could share an insight with the class. </p>

<subheading type="ref"> MOSES 4:1&#8211;13; 5:1&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We need agency and opposition in order to grow. </subheading>
<p> Because agency &#8212; the God-given right to make choices is such a fundamental part of mortal life, we sometimes take it for granted. To deepen class members' appreciation for this gift, they could read and discuss Moses 4:1&#8211;4. What do these verses teach about the importance of agency? Why would God's plan be destroyed if we did not have agency? The quotation in "Additional Resources" could provide some insights. </p>
<p> Perhaps class members studied President Dallin H. Oaks's message "Opposition in All Things" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 114&#8211;17) as part of their individual or family study this week. During the week, you might consider inviting a few people to come prepared to share something from his message that helped them understand the Fall of Adam and Eve (see especially sections I and II). Why does Heavenly Father allow us to experience "opposition in all things"? (see 2 Nephi 2:11&#8211;16). You might invite class members to read Doctrine and Covenants 29:39&#8211;40 and discuss why Satan's temptations are necessary in God's plan. How do Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ help us when we face temptation? </p>

<p> Moses 4:4&#8211;12; 5:13&#8211;33 can help your class members identify some ways in which Satan tempts us to do evil. You might ask half of the class to read Moses 4:4&#8211;12 and the other half to read Moses 5:13, 18&#8211;33. As they read, they could list ways Satan tried to tempt Adam and Eve and their children.

<subheading type="sub-title"> Jesus Christ's Atonement offers hope and redemption from the Fall. </subheading>
<p> The more we understand the effects of the Fall, the more we appreciate the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Class members could search for the effects of the Fall in Genesis 3:1&#8211;7; Moses 4:22&#8211;31 and list what they find on the board. Then they could search Moses 5:4&#8211;12, 14&#8211;15 to learn about God's plan to redeem us from those effects (see also 2 Nephi 2:19&#8211;25; Alma 12:22&#8211;34) and list what they find on the board. They could also share what impresses them about Adam's and Eve's testimonies of Jesus Christ found in verses 10&#8211;12. How do we feel about God's plan after reading these scriptures? </p>
<p> Adam and Eve's story of hope and redemption can encourage class members when life is difficult. Consider inviting them to find words and phrases in Moses 5:7&#8211;12 that express the hope that Adam and Eve felt hope similar to what Adam and Eve felt? Consider inviting class members to share their favorite hymns expressing the hope that comes through the Savior's Atonement. You could sing a few of these together. </p>

<p> Before you read any additional materials, read and ponder Genesis 5 and Moses 6, and record your spiritual impressions. <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> and this outline can give you ideas about how to help those you teach discover truths relevant to them. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> How can you encourage class members to share insights and experiences they had as they studied Genesis 5 and Moses 6? You could write the names <i> Adam </i> and <i> Enoch </i> on the board and invite class members to write something that one of these prophets did or taught that was meaningful to them. </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Teach the Doctrine MOSES 6:26&#8211;39 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord calls us to do His work despite our inadequacies. </subheading> 
<p> There's a good chance that someone in your class has felt &#8212; or is feeling &#8212; inadequate about a responsibility at home or at church. To build class members' faith that the Lord can help them, you could invite them to read Enoch's experience found in Moses 6:26&#8211;39. How did God help Enoch do His work despite Enoch's fears? Ask class members to think about other examples of people who overcame their weaknesses and accomplished the Lord's work, either from the scriptures or their own lives. What examples can we share? (see also Exodus 4:10&#8211;16; Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;10; 2 Nephi 33:1&#8211;4; Ether 12:23&#8211;29). </p>
<p> Many modern-day apostles and prophets have expressed concerns similar to Enoch's when they have described how it felt to receive their calls. Their experiences could enhance class members' understanding of Moses 6:26&#8211;39. Consider reviewing the video "On the Lord's Errand: The Life of Thomas S. Monson" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org; between minutes 35:46 and 39:40) or a talk by a recently called member of the Quorum of the Twelve (for example, see the testimonies of Elder Ronald A. Rasband, Elder Gary E. Stevenson, and Elder Dale G. Renlund [Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 89&#8211;94]). Let class members share what impresses them about these examples. What can we learn from these leaders about our own feelings of inadequacy? The statement from President Thomas S. Monson in "Additional Resources" may also be helpful as part of this discussion. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> MOSES 6:48&#8211;65 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the Holy Ghost prepare us to return to God. </subheading> 
<p> This week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> suggests reading Moses 6:48&#8211;62 to find what each of us must know and do to be redeemed. Perhaps class members could share any insights that came from that study in their homes. Or you could discuss Moses 6:48&#8211;62 together in class. How would we respond to someone who asks why faith, repentance, baptism, and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost are necessary? How does the Lord answer this question in verses 53&#8211;65, and what do we learn from His answer? </p>

<subheading type="ref"> MOSES 6:51&#8211;63 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Teach these things freely unto your children." </subheading>
<p> In Moses 6:51&#8211;63 we learn of gospel truths that the Lord taught to Adam and asked him to teach to future generations. Perhaps class members could make a list of these truths by studying smaller groups of verses, such as verses 51&#8211;52, 53&#8211;57, 58&#8211;60, 61&#8211;63. Why are these truths valuable to today's rising generation? What would you want young people to know about the Savior from these verses? Class members may be willing to share ideas or experiences to help each other teach these truths more effectively to children and youth. What else can we learn from the Lord's instructions to parents in Mosiah 4:14&#8211;15 and Doctrine and Covenants 68:25&#8211;28; 93:40&#8211;50? </p>
<p> To add to what Moses 6 teaches about parents' responsibility to teach their children, you might invite class members to watch one or more of the following videos: "Parenting: Touching the Hearts of Our Youth," "Proclamation Series: Children," or "Mother in Israel" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). What do we learn from these videos about teaching the gospel to our children? If you are teaching youth, you could invite them to share how they can support their parents in their efforts to teach the gospel at home. </p>

<p> As you study Moses 7, think about the people you teach and how you can help them understand what this chapter teaches about Zion and other gospel principles. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Sometimes a simple question and a few minutes to ponder are enough to help people share what they are learning at home. Perhaps you could give class members a little time to review Moses 7, find a verse that makes them feel thankful for the truths restored in the book of Moses, and then share it. </p>

<p type="bullet"> What would be the best way to introduce the concept of Zion in your class? One idea could be to contact class members during the week before class and invite them to bring an object from home that they feel represents the characteristics of the people of Zion, as described in Moses 7:18.

<p type="bullet"> The video "We Come Together and Unite as One" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) could help you start a discussion about how we can be "of one heart and one mind" (Moses 7:18) in our wards and families. Consider asking class members to think about times when they have felt unity within their families or while serving with others in the Church or community. What did people do to create unity in these situations? What can we learn about Zion and unity from Moses 7? (see especially verses 16&#8211;21, 27, 53, 62&#8211;69). Here are some other scriptures that could help: Philippians 2:1&#8211;4; 4 Nephi 1:15&#8211;18; Doctrine and Covenants 97:21; 105:5. </p>

Why is it a blessing to have a record of Enoch's vision &#8212; one of the earliest prophecies of the Second Coming? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<p> Elder Jeffrey R. Holland taught: </p>
<p> "In the midst of a grand vision of humankind which heaven opened to his view, Enoch, observing both the blessings and challenges of mortality, turns his gaze toward the Father and is stunned to see Him weeping. He says in wonder and amazement to this most powerful Being in the universe: 'How is it that thou canst weep?". . . </p>
<p> "Looking out on the events of almost any day, God replies: 'Behold these thy brethren; they are the workmanship of mine own hands. . . . I gave unto them. . .[a] commandment, that they should love one another, and that they should choose me, their Father; but behold, they are without affection, and they hate their own blood. . . . Wherefore should not the heavens weep, seeing these shall suffer?' [Moses 7:29&#8211;33, 37]. </p>
<p> "That single, riveting scene does more to teach the true nature of God than any theological treatise could ever convey. . . . What an indelible image of God's engagement in our lives! What anguish in a parent when His children do not choose Him nor 'the gospel of God' He sent! [Romans 1:1]. How easy to love someone who so singularly loves us!"

<p> The account of the people of Babel building a tower provides an interesting contrast to the account of Enoch and his people building Zion, which class members studied last week. Both groups of people were trying to reach heaven but in different ways. You might invite class members to list on the board anything they remember about the people of Zion (see Moses 7:18&#8211;19, 53, 62&#8211;63, 69) and what they learn from Genesis 11:1&#8211;9 and Helaman 6:26&#8211;28 about the people of Babel. What differences do they find? What does this teach us about our own efforts to return to God's presence? </p>
<graphics-caption> Illustration of the Tower of Babel, by David Green </graphics-caption>
<p> The ancient city of Babel no longer exists, but the pride and worldliness it symbolizes do. To help class members apply lessons from the Tower of Babel to their lives, start by inviting them to review Genesis 11:1&#8211;9. Then you could distribute slips of paper and invite the class members to write things people do that draw them away from God; then, on other slips of paper, they could write things people do that draw them nearer to God. Youth might enjoy arranging the first group of papers on the board in the shape of a tower and the second group in the shape of a temple. What has God provided to help us "reach unto heaven"? (Genesis 11:4; see also John 3:16). You might sing a hymn on this topic, such as "Nearer, My God, to Thee" (Hymns, no. 100). </p>

<p> President Henry B. Eyring said: </p>
<p> "The failure to take prophetic counsel lessens our power to take inspired counsel in the future. The best time to have decided to help Noah build the ark was the first time he asked. Each time he asked after that, each failure to respond would have lessened sensitivity to the Spirit. And so each time his request would have seemed more foolish, until the rain came. And then it was too late. </p>
<p> "Every time in my life when I have chosen to delay following inspired counsel or decided that I was an exception, I came to know that I had put myself in harm's way. Every time that I have listened to the counsel of prophets, felt it confirmed in prayer, and then followed it, I have found that I moved toward safety" ("Finding Safety in Counsel," Ensign, May 1997, 25). </p>

<p type="bullet"> The experiences of Abraham and Sarah recorded in Genesis 15; 17; Abraham 1 can help class members maintain faith that their righteous desires will be fulfilled in the Lord's time. How can you begin a discussion about this principle? One idea is to invite the class to search Genesis 15:1&#8211;6 and Abraham 1:1&#8211;19 and describe Abraham's desires and difficult circumstances. How did Abraham and Sarah demonstrate their faith in times of difficulty? (see Hebrews 11:8&#8211;13). How were their righteous desires eventually fulfilled? (see Genesis 17:15&#8211;22; 21:1&#8211;3; Doctrine and Covenants 132:29; Abraham 1:31). How can we demonstrate our faith when our righteous desires are not yet fulfilled as we would like them to be? Perhaps class members could share how the Savior has supported them in such situations. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Some members of your class may receive little support from their families as they strive to live the gospel &#8212; and they may even face opposition.

<p type="bullet"> You might ask class members to read Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 14:36&#8211;40 (in the Bible appendix) and share what they learn about Abraham's faith and desires. They could also share how they have been blessed when they have exercised their faith to pay tithing. </p>

<p> ". . . I plead with you not to dwell on days now gone nor to yearn vainly for yesterdays, however good those yesterdays may have been. The past is to be learned from but not lived in. We look back to claim the embers from glowing experiences but not the ashes. And when we have learned what we need to learn and have brought with us the best that we have experienced, then we look ahead and remember that <i> faith is always pointed toward the future </i> . . . . </p>
<p> ". . . [Lot's wife] did not have faith. She doubted the Lord's ability to give her something better than she already had. Apparently, she thought that nothing that lay ahead could possibly be as good as what she was leaving behind. . . . </p>

<p> As you read Genesis 24&#8211;27, pray to know how you can encourage class members to have their own experiences learning from the scriptures. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> To encourage class members to share their insights from Genesis 24&#8211;27, you could invite them to select a specific passage that inspired them and write it on a slip of paper. Collect the papers, and choose several to read and discuss as a class. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 24 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Covenant marriage is essential to God's eternal plan. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> The importance Abraham placed on finding a wife for Isaac provides an opportunity to discuss the importance of covenant marriage in God's plan for us. To start the discussion, class members could scan Genesis 24 and share things the Lord did to help bring Isaac and Rebekah together in marriage. Why is marriage important to the Lord? To help class members discuss this question, you could share with them Elder D. Todd Christofferson's statement in "Additional Resources." How can we help ensure that God's purposes for marriage are accomplished? </p>
<p type="bullet"> Ask class members what qualities they have seen in a spouse, parents, or other married couples that have contributed to a faithful, happy marriage. The account in Genesis 24 demonstrates qualities that can help a person create happiness in marriage &#8212; and other aspects of life. For example, in verse 12 we learn about being guided by prayer, and in verse 19 we learn about giving extra effort in service. What other principles can be found in these chapters? Class members might also look in "The Family: A Proclamation to the World" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 25:29&#8211;34 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We can choose between immediate gratification and things of greater value. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> How might you help class members find personal lessons from Jacob and Esau's experiences? One idea is to invite them to make two lists on the board &#8212; one of eternal blessings God wants to give us and another of worldly things that distract us from those blessings. Then class members could read Genesis 25:29&#8211;34, replacing "birthright" with something from the first list and "pottage" with something from the second list. How does the adversary try to convince us to exchange God's blessings for things that are less valuable? Consider inviting class members to give each other advice on how to focus on the Savior and the eternal blessings He offers us. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 26:18&#8211;25, 32&#8211;33 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Jesus Christ is the well of living water. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Genesis 26 mentions several times that Isaac and his household had to dig wells to find water, and this often required great effort. This fact could help you teach class members about the effort required to bring the Savior's "living water" into our lives (see John 4:10). Perhaps you could illustrate this with a drawing on the board of a water source covered by deep dirt. Class members could take turns erasing some of the dirt as they describe how they can find the Savior's living water. Encourage them to use the Guide to the Scriptures to find verses that relate to the things they share. </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Marriage and family are God's creation. </subheading>
<p> Elder D. Todd Christofferson gave some reasons why marriage and family are so important to God's plan: </p>
<p> "A family built on the marriage of a man and woman supplies the best setting for God's plan to thrive &#8212; the setting for the birth of children, who come in purity and innocence from God, and the environment for the learning and preparation they will need for a successful mortal life and eternal life in the world to come. A critical mass of families built on such marriages is vital for societies to survive and flourish. . . . </p>
<p> ". . . But our claims for the role of marriage and family rest not on social science but on the truth that they are God's creation. It is He who in the beginning created Adam and Eve in His image, male and female, and joined them as husband and wife to become one flesh' and to multiply and replenish the earth. Each individual carries the divine image, but it is in the matrimonial union of male and female as one that we attain perhaps the most complete meaning of our having been made in the image of God &#8212; male and female. . . . Such marriage. . . is as much a part of the plan of happiness as the Fall and the Atonement" ("Why Marriage, Why Family," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 52). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Center your teaching on doctrine. </b> As you invite class members to share, make sure you continually bring the discussion back to the doctrine in the scriptures.

<heading type="title"> "SURELY THE LORD IS IN THIS PLACE" </heading>
<p> As you prepare to teach, prayerfully consider which principles in Genesis 28&#8211;33 might be most helpful to your class members. The following ideas are meant to add to your personal study and inspiration. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> One blessing of being gathered in a Sunday School class is that members can help each other find meaning in the scriptures. Encourage class members to share with someone sitting nearby what the Holy Ghost taught them as they studied the scriptures this week. A few could be invited to share with the class what they discussed. This might create a good starting place for your class discussion. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 28:10&#8211;22 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> In the temple we make covenants with God. </subheading> 
<p> How might you help class members find meaning in Jacob's experience at Bethel, as described in Genesis 28:10&#8211;22? They could start by reviewing Genesis 27:41&#8211;45; 28:1&#8211;5 and considering Jacob's life at the time. How might Jacob have been feeling? Class members could then explore Genesis 28:10&#8211;22. How did this experience bless Jacob? How might he have been comforted? How might Jacob's experience inspire us as we worship in the temple? The class could also sing, read, or listen to "Nearer, My God, to Thee," which is based on these verses (Hymns, no. 100). They could share phrases from the song or from Genesis 28:10&#8211;22 that remind them of experiences they have had with trying to draw nearer to the Savior. </p>
<p> The ladder Jacob saw in his dream has often been compared to temple covenants. Maybe you could show or draw a picture of a ladder and a temple. Class members could review Genesis 28:10&#8211;22 and talk about what the ladder in Jacob's dream teaches us about the temple. What else do we find in these verses that reminds us of blessings we receive because of our temple covenants? (See "About the Temple Endowment" and "About a Temple Sealing" [temples.ChurchofJesusChrist.org].) </p>
<p> To help class members ponder the promises of the Abrahamic covenant, which the Lord renewed with Jacob, you could invite them to read Genesis 28:10&#8211;15 and talk about how we can receive these blessings today (see also Genesis 12:2&#8211;3). They could also read President Russell M. Nelson's statement in "Additional Resources," looking for blessings that come from making and keeping covenants. How was Jacob blessed by receiving the promises found in Genesis 28:10&#8211;15? What connections do we see between the events in these verses and the events in Genesis 29 and 30 (Jacob getting married and the births of his children)? How does the Lord bless us as we make and keep sacred covenants? </p>

<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 32&#8211;33 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Savior can help us overcome discord in our families. </subheading>
<p> Genesis 32&#8211;33 could be inspiring to class members who want to find healing in their family relationships. It might be helpful to ask a class member to briefly summarize the events recorded in Genesis 27. This week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> includes questions to ponder while studying Genesis 32&#8211;33. Perhaps class members could select one of these questions and look for answers in the chapters. They may also be willing to share experiences they have had with strengthening strained relationships in their families. Encourage them to talk about how Heavenly Father helped them. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We are children of the covenant. </subheading>
<p> President Russell M. Nelson taught: </p>
<p> "At baptism we covenant to serve the Lord and keep His commandments. When we partake of the sacrament, we renew that covenant and declare our willingness to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Thereby we are adopted as His sons and daughters and are known as brothers and sisters. He is the father of our new life. Ultimately, in the holy temple, we may become joint heirs to the blessings of an eternal family, as once promised to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their posterity. Thus, celestial marriage is the covenant of exaltation. </p>
<p> "When we realize that we are children of the covenant, we know who we are and what God expects of us. His law is written in our hearts. He is our God and we are His people. Committed children of the covenant remain steadfast, even in the midst of adversity. When that doctrine is deeply implanted in our hearts, even the sting of death is soothed and our spiritual stamina is strengthened" ("Covenants," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 88). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Help learners act on promptings. </b> "True conversion involves more than just feeling the Spirit confirming truth to our souls; we must also act on those truths. In addition to helping learners feel and recognize the Spirit, help them act on the promptings they receive" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 10). </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> To encourage class members to share what they learned in their personal and family study, you could invite them to find a phrase in Genesis 37&#8211;41 that expresses a lesson or principle they feel is important. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 37:1&#8211;28; 39; 40:1&#8211;19; 41:9&#8211;45 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "The Lord was with Joseph" in his adversity. </subheading>
<p> Like Joseph, members of your class may be experiencing difficult trials. To help the class find inspiration in Joseph's example, you could divide them into three groups and ask each group to review one of the following scripture passages: Genesis 39; 40:1&#8211;19; or 41:9&#8211;45. Each group could then share the ways the Lord was with Joseph in his challenges. As appropriate, class members could share experiences when the Lord was with them during a difficult trial. How can we learn to better see the Lord's presence in our lives? </p>
<p> This object lesson can help illustrate how we can rise above adversity: place a lightweight object, such as a small plastic ball, at the bottom of a container filled about halfway with dry rice or beans. Invite someone to shake the container gently until the ball rises to the top. How was Joseph like the ball? Class members could share examples of the Lord helping Joseph rise above adversity from Genesis 37:5&#8211;11; 39; 40:1&#8211;19; 41:9&#8211;45. They could also share times when the Lord helped them in similar ways. </p>
<p> You might ask class members to sing or read the words of a hymn about making righteous choices, such as "Do What Is Right" (Hymns, no. 237). Then class members could find insights or phrases in Genesis 37:1&#8211;28; 39; 40:1&#8211;19; 41:9&#8211;45 that illustrate the hymn's messages. How was Joseph blessed, despite his adversity, when he did what was right? When has the Lord blessed us in times of adversity for doing the right thing? </p>

<p> Although not everyone receives personal revelation through dreams, there are things we can learn about revelation from the experiences of Joseph, Pharaoh's servants, and Pharaoh. You could invite class members to review Genesis 37:5&#8211;11; 40:5&#8211;8; 41:14&#8211;25, 37&#8211;38 and share anything they learn about revelation. You could also invite them to share what has helped them prepare to receive, understand, and act on revelation. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> With the Lord's help, we can flee temptation. </subheading>
<p> You might ask class members to share what they learned about resisting temptation as they read Genesis 39 this week. What did Joseph do to overcome temptation? (see verses 7&#8211;12). The videos "Leave the Party" and "Dare to Stand Alone" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) provide examples of people who resisted temptation. Consider asking class members to make a list of things we can do to draw on God's power when we face temptations. (Class members could find ideas in Matthew 4:1&#8211;11 or in the scriptures listed under "Tempt, Temptation" in Guide to the Scriptures [scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org].) </p>
<p> How can you use Joseph's example to help class members resist temptation to commit sexual sin? In addition to reviewing Genesis 39:1&#8211;20, class members could watch the video "Chastity: What Are the Limits?" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) or review "Sexual Purity" (in For the Strength of Youth [2011], 35&#8211;37). They could share what they learn about resisting thoughts, words, and actions that lead to sexual sin. Reviewing "Repentance" (in For the Strength of Youth, 28&#8211;29) can help class members understand the opportunity that Jesus Christ offers us to repent. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 41:15&#8211;57 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We should prepare for possible hardships. </subheading>
<p> You could ask one class member to describe Pharaoh's dreams (see Genesis 41:15&#8211;24) and another one to share Joseph's interpretations (see verses 25&#8211;32). What did Joseph propose to do? (see verses 33&#8211;36, 47&#8211;49). What lessons does this account have for our day? (see President Gordon B. Hinckley's counsel in "Additional Resources"). </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> To give class members an opportunity to share something they found meaningful in their personal or family scripture study, you could ask questions like these at the beginning of class: What verse in these chapters caught your attention? What verse did you find yourself reading more than once? What verse did you share with someone? What verse led to an insightful discussion with your family or friends? </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Forgiveness brings peace. </subheading>
<p> Before you start a discussion about what Joseph's experience teaches about forgiveness, it might help to have someone briefly relate the story in Genesis 37; 39&#8211;45. Why might it have been hard for Joseph to forgive his brothers? What experiences or attitudes might have given Joseph the strength to forgive? (see, for example, Genesis 45:1&#8211;15 or 50:15&#8211;21). How can Joseph's example help us be more forgiving? </p>
<p> The video "Forgiveness: My Burden Was Made Light" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) provides another inspiring example of forgiveness. How does the Savior help us forgive others? </p>
<p> What blessings came from Joseph's forgiveness of his brothers? It might be interesting to compare the relationships in Jacob's family at the beginning of the story (see, for example, Genesis 37:3&#8211;11) with their state at the end (see Genesis 45:9&#8211;15; 50:15&#8211;21). What role did forgiveness play in the change in Joseph's family? How might things have turned out differently if Joseph had not been willing to forgive? You might invite class members to suggest ways this story could help families today overcome contention and jealousy. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> GENESIS 45:5&#8211;11; JOSEPH SMITH TRANSLATION, GENESIS 50:24&#8211;38 (IN THE BIBLE APPENDIX) </subheading>
<p> With the additional light of the restored gospel, we know that Joseph, who delivered his family from famine, also prophesied of great blessings that would one day come through Moses and Joseph Smith. And all of these prophets point us to our Great Deliverer, Jesus Christ. To help class members see the Savior in the ministries of these three prophets, you could draw a chart on the board similar to the one found in "Additional Resources." Class members could work together to fill it out. Then they could add columns describing the work of Joseph of Egypt, Moses, and Joseph Smith, using what they learn from Genesis 45:5&#8211;11 and Joseph Smith Translation, Genesis 50:24&#8211;38 (in the Bible appendix). How do the ministries of these prophets testify of and point to the mission of the Savior? (For some examples of similarities between the life of Joseph of Egypt and the life of the Savior, see Genesis 37:3 and Matthew 3:17; Genesis 37:26&#8211;28 and Matthew 26:14&#8211;16; Genesis 45:5&#8211;7 and Luke 4:18; and Genesis 47:12 and John 6:35; see also Moses 6:63.) </p>

<p> Though it may not have been clear while he was going through his severe trials, Joseph was eventually able to look back on his adversity in Egypt and see that "God meant it unto good (Genesis 50:20). If we could have visited Joseph while he was in the pit or in prison, how might we have comforted him? How might the thought expressed in Genesis 50:19&#8211;21 help us in times of trial? Perhaps class members would be willing to talk about ways God has blessed them, even through difficult experiences they've had. For one example, see the video "Unto All the World: The Sam Family" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). What does Doctrine and Covenants 122 add to our understanding of this principle? </p>

How are these descriptions similar to the spiritual captivity or other hardships we face? How did the children of Israel seek deliverance, and how did God respond to them? (see also Exodus 2:23&#8211;25; 3:7&#8211;8). How do we draw on God's power when we need deliverance? How does God answer our pleas for help?

<subheading type="sub-title"> As we do the Lord's work, we can have the Lord's power. </subheading>
<p> This week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> suggests searching Exodus 3&#8211;4 to find out how the Lord responded to Moses's concerns about the task of delivering the Israelites from bondage. If members of your class did this activity at home, invite them to share what they learned. Or you could do this activity as a class. Specifically, class members could search Exodus 3:11&#8211;18; 4:1&#8211;17, looking for Moses's concerns and the Lord's responses to each.

<p> How can you use Moses's example to inspire a discussion about how we should treat sacred things? For example, after reading Exodus 3:5 together, you could display sacred objects or pictures of sacred things (such as the scriptures or temples) and common objects or pictures of common things (such as secular books or regular buildings). Class members could talk about other things they consider sacred and share how they show reverence for those things (see also Leviticus 19:30; Doctrine and Covenants 6:10&#8211;12).

<p> It can be discouraging when our sincere efforts to do good don't seem to be working &#8212; perhaps a friend is not responding to our ministering efforts or our prayers for a wayward child seem to go unanswered. To learn about a similar experience Moses had, class members could read Exodus 5:4&#8211;9, 20&#8211;23. How did the Lord help Moses overcome his feelings of discouragement? (see Exodus 6:1&#8211;13). Class members could share experiences when they did not see immediate results from their efforts to serve the Lord.

<p> "We realized that we were sincerely striving to serve this family and to serve our bishop, but we had to ask ourselves if we were really serving out of love for the Lord. King Benjamin made clear this distinction when he stated, 'Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for <i> I have only been in the service of God' </i> [Mosiah 2:16; emphasis added]. </p>
<p> "So whom was King Benjamin really serving? Heavenly Father and the Savior. Knowing the <i> who </i> and the <i> why </i> in serving others helps us understand that the highest manifestation of love is devotion to God" ("For Him," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2018, 50). </p>

<heading type="title"> "REMEMBER THIS DAY, IN WHICH YE CAME OUT FROM EGYPT" </heading>
<p> Your ability to be guided by the Spirit in your teaching will be greatly enhanced as you have your own spiritual experience with studying Exodus 7&#8211;13. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Think of a question or two that will encourage class members to share insights and experiences they had as they studied Exodus 7&#8211;13 individually and with their families. For example, you might ask, "What did you read this week that strengthened your faith in Jesus Christ?" or "What did you read that was a blessing to your family?" </p>

<subheading type="ref"> EXODUS 7&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We can choose to soften our hearts. </subheading>
<p> To help class members think about their willingness to yield their hearts to God, you could ask them to each read one of the following scripture passages: Exodus 7:14&#8211;25; 8:5&#8211;15; 8:16&#8211;19; 8:20&#8211;32; 9:1&#8211;7; 9:8&#8211;12; 9:22&#8211;26; 10:12&#8211;15; 10:21&#8211;29; 12:29&#8211;33. Then they could write on the board words or phrases that describe how Pharaoh responded to the ten plagues sent by God upon the Egyptians. (You may want to note that Joseph Smith Translation revisions show that Pharaoh hardened his own heart.) Why might Pharaoh have responded the way he did? Why is it sometimes difficult to yield our hearts and wills to God? How do Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ help us overcome these difficulties? </p>
<p> By bringing to class a hard object and a soft object, you could help class members understand what it means to have a hard or a soft heart. You could pass the two objects around the class, while someone reads one of the descriptions of Pharaoh's heart found in Exodus 7&#8211;10 (such as Exodus 9:22&#8211;35). Why is "hard" a good description of Pharaoh's heart? What do these verses teach about what it means to have a soft heart? (If it helps, class members could look for insights in one or more of these scriptures: 1 Nephi 2:16; Mosiah 3:19; Alma 24:7&#8211;8; 62:41; Ether 12:27.) How does the Savior help us soften our hearts? The video "A Change of Heart" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) could add to their understanding. </p>
<p> To help class members think about why the Lord sent the plagues on Egypt, you could invite each class member to choose one reference from the following list and find possible reasons: Exodus 3:20; 7:5, 17; 9:14&#8211;16; 10:1&#8211;2. You could also invite class members to share how they have learned that "there is none like [Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ] in all the earth" (Exodus 9:14). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> EXODUS 12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Passover and the sacrament teach about deliverance through Jesus Christ. </subheading>
<p> Celebrating the Feast of the Passover helped the children of Israel remember that the Lord had delivered them from captivity. To help class members understand the symbolism of the Passover, you could create two columns on the board labeled <i> Symbol </i> and <i> Possible Meaning, </i> with a picture of Jesus Christ above the columns. Class members could study Exodus 12:1&#8211;13 and write on the board anything from these verses that could symbolize our deliverance through Jesus Christ. They could then discuss what these symbols teach us about the Savior's Atonement (see the table in "Additional Resources" for a few ideas). The video "The Passover" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) can help them visualize what they read in Exodus 12. </p>
<graphics-caption> Like the Passover meal, the sacrament helps us remember our Deliverer, Jesus Christ. </graphics-caption>
<p> For some people, the sacrament is not always as spiritual as it could be. Consider how a discussion of Exodus 12 could help all class members find deeper meaning in the sacrament. For example, after class members review Exodus 12, you might invite them to share what Israelites from that time period might have said if a son or daughter had asked them what the Passover meant to them. Class members could then discuss what they could say if someone asked what the sacrament say means to them, including any insights they gain from the Passover. You might give class members time to ponder what they can do to remember the Savior daily. The video "Always Remember Him" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) could help them. </p>

Also encourage them to share their experiences with being delivered from trials, along with verses from the chapter that build their faith that God can deliver us. </p>
<p> It might also be interesting to read together Doctrine and Covenants 8:2&#8211;3. What do these verses teach about Moses?

<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord will provide for our needs as we journey through life. </subheading>
<p> Exodus 15&#8211;17 gives multiple accounts that can build class members' faith in the Lord's power and willingness to provide for our physical and spiritual needs. Maybe each class member could study one of the following passages, looking for spiritual messages: Exodus 15:23&#8211;27; 16:1&#8211;15; 17:1&#8211;7. Give several class members a chance to share what they found. How might we use these accounts to encourage someone who has unmet temporal or spiritual needs? </p>
<p> Class members could also read these verses and identify examples of murmuring. How might we explain to someone what it means to murmur? What are some of the consequences of murmuring that make it so dangerous? Perhaps class members could share advice on how to avoid the temptation to murmur against the Lord when we experience difficult trials. </p>
<p> It might help class members to compare manna described in Exodus 16 with the nourishment our spirits need. What similarities do we see? What spiritual lessons might the Lord have wanted to teach the Israelites by sending manna in the way He did? (see John 6:31&#8211;35, 48&#8211;58).

<subheading type="sub-title"> You can receive personalized direction. </subheading>
<p> Sister Michelle Craig taught: </p>
<p> "As [the Savior's] faithful disciple, you can receive personal inspiration and revelation, consistent with His commandments, that is tailored to you. You have unique missions and roles to perform in life and will be given unique guidance to fulfill them. </p>
<p> "Nephi, the brother of Jared, and even Moses all had a large body of water to cross &#8212; and each did it differently. Nephi worked 'timbers of curious workmanship' [1 Nephi 18:1]. The brother of Jared built barges that were 'tight like unto a dish' [see Ether 6:5&#8211;8]. And Moses 'walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea' [Exodus 14:29]. </p>
<p> "They each received personalized direction, tailored to them, and each trusted and acted. The Lord is mindful of those who obey and, in the words of Nephi, will 'prepare a way for [us to] accomplish the thing which he commandeth' [1 Nephi 3:7]. Note that Nephi says, 'a way' &#8212; not 'the way.' </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Perhaps you could invite class members to share what they or their family did to strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement during this Easter season. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Because the Savior conquered death, we too shall live again. </subheading>
<p> Since today is Easter Sunday, consider reviewing the scriptural account of the first Easter &#8212; the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (see John 20:1&#8211;17). You could invite a class member to tell the story in his or her own words. You could also show the video "He Is Risen" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Class members might also enjoy singing hymns about the Savior and reading related scriptures (references are listed at the bottom of each song in Hymns). Class members could then share favorite phrases from the hymns and their feelings about the Savior. </p>
<p> To help your class appreciate how the Old Testament testifies of Jesus Christ, you could invite them to review the scriptures in the table in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families, as well as the Book of Mormon passages that accompany the table. What do we learn about the Savior and His mission from these passages? Why is it valuable to know about these prophecies? </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We can find peace and joy through the Savior's Atonement. </subheading>
<p> This week's outline in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families includes a list of scriptures describing the peace and joy that come through Jesus Christ. If class members read these scriptures at home, encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings about them. Or you could read a few scriptures as a class and talk about the peace and joy we feel because of the Savior and His Atonement. How can we share these blessings with people who may be struggling to find peace and joy in their lives? You could also invite a class member to read President Russell M. Nelson's message "Joy and Spiritual Survival" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 81&#8211;84) during the week preceding class and to come to class prepared to share what this message teaches about finding joy in the Savior. </p>
<p> You might feel inspired to lead a discussion about how to help others find peace and joy in Christ. You could invite class members to think about someone they know &#8212; perhaps someone they minister to &#8212; who might need their support, service, or even simply to hear their testimony of Christ and His Atonement. Encourage class members to refer to the scriptures (such as those in "Additional Resources") as they consider service they might give or testimonies they might share to strengthen those around them. Invite a few class members to share their thoughts about serving as Jesus did. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Through His Atonement, Jesus Christ has power to help us overcome sin, death, trials, and weaknesses. </subheading>
<p> One way to help class members ponder the blessings that come through the Savior's Atonement could be to write on the board the headings Sin, Death, Trials, and Weaknesses. Each class member could read one of the scriptures listed in "Additional Resources" and ponder how the Savior helps us overcome the things written on the board. Class members could write their scripture references under one or more of the headings on the board and share their testimonies of the Savior and His Atonement. </p>
<p> Stories and analogies can help us understand Jesus Christ's Atonement. For instance, you could invite a class member to share one of the stories or analogies in Elder Walter F. Gonz&#225;lez's message "The Savior's Touch" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 90&#8211;92) or Sister Neill F. Marriott's message "Abiding in God and Repairing the Breach" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 10&#8211;12). What do these stories and analogies teach us about Christ's Atonement? Invite class members to work in pairs to think of their own stories or analogies. </p>
<p> What do we learn from the following verses about the price Jesus Christ paid for our salvation: Isaiah 53:3&#8211;5; Mosiah 3:7; Doctrine and Covenants 19:16&#8211;19? What price did our Heavenly Father pay? (see John 3:16). </p>

<p> "Intangible things make just as ready gods. Degrees and letters and titles can become idols. </p>
<p> "Many people build and furnish a home and buy the automobile first &#8212; and then find they 'cannot afford' to pay tithing. Whom do they worship? Certainly not the Lord of heaven and earth. . . . </p>
<p> "Many worship the hunt, the fishing trip, the vacation, the weekend picnics and outings. Others have as their idols the games of sport, baseball, football, the bullfight, or golf. . . . </p>
<p> "Still another image men worship is that of power and prestige. . . . These gods of power, wealth, and influence are most demanding and are quite as real as the golden calves of the children of Israel in the wilderness" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W.

<p> You might begin by asking class members if they have ever had to explain to a family member or friend why they treat Sundays differently from other days. Invite them to share what they said or what they might say in the future. Reading Exodus 31:12&#8211;17 or the statement in "Additional Resources can give them additional ideas. How do our choices on the Sabbath demonstrate our commitment to Jesus Christ? </p>
<p> Even though the penalties described in Exodus 31:14&#8211;15 don't apply today, they do indicate how strongly the Lord feels about the Sabbath. Why is this commandment so important? Discussing these scriptures can help: Exodus 31:12&#8211;17; Isaiah 58:13&#8211;14; Doctrine and Covenants 59:9&#8211;13. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Sin is turning away from God, but He offers a way back. </subheading>
<p> To help class members ponder and personalize the account in Exodus 32, first ask them to review the chapter individually or in groups. Then ask some class members to take the role of Israelites who grew impatient waiting for Moses to return and decided to make a golden idol. What feelings might have led them to idol worship? Other class members could try to persuade them to stay true to the Lord and His prophet. Class members could talk about what inspires them to keep their covenants. What can we do to help those who might be struggling to keep their covenants? </p>
<p> When people read the Old Testament, they are sometimes surprised at the strict punishments the Lord prescribed for sin. Exodus 34:1&#8211;9 can help them see that while God does not condone sin, He is also merciful, offering forgiveness to those who repent. Perhaps class members could read this passage and ponder questions like these: What do we learn about the Lord from these verses? Why do we need to know these things about Him? You might point out that Joseph Smith Translation, Exodus 34:7 (in Exodus 34:7, footnote e) clarifies that God will not "clear the rebellious." What might this mean? Perhaps class members could share how they have witnessed God's mercy. How is it possible for God to be both perfectly merciful and perfectly just? (see Alma 42:13&#8211;15). </p>
<p> Exodus 34:6&#8211;17 can be seen as instruction to help the Israelites repent of their sin of idolatry (described in Exodus 32). What do we find in these verses that might have helped the Israelites repent? What do we learn about the Lord and repentance from this instruction? </p>

What do we find in verses 11&#8211;17 that would have strengthened and comforted Moses? Class members could think about something God wants them to do &#8212; such as fulfilling a Church calling, a family responsibility, or a ministering opportunity. They could then read the verses again. What insights do we gain about how God will support us? </p>

With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don'ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, 'What sign do I want to give to God?'

<subheading type="ref"> EXODUS 35&#8211;40 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord wants us to become holy as He is. </subheading>
<p> As class members studied Exodus 35&#8211;40 this week, they may have pondered how elements of the ancient tabernacle turn their thoughts to Jesus Christ. If they did, encourage them to share their thoughts. The table in this week's outline in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families could help with this discussion. You could also talk about what these symbols connected with the tabernacle teach about becoming more holy. How does Jesus Christ help us become more holy? </p>
<p> For many, the idea of becoming more holy may seem out of reach. How will you help class members understand that becoming holy is part of Heavenly Father's plan for us? You could read together President Henry B. Eyring's statement in "Additional Resources." What does it mean to become holy? How do our latter-day temples and the work we do there help us become more holy? (see also Doctrine and Covenants 84:19&#8211;24; 109:6&#8211;26; 128:15&#8211;18). You could then ask class members to share how these things have helped them &#8212; or others they know &#8212; become more holy. </p>
<p> The Israelites' tabernacle in the wilderness is similar in many ways to our latter-day temples. You might invite class members to list things they learned about the tabernacle in Exodus 35&#8211;40 that remind them of what we experience in the temple. If they need help, you could point them to verses in Exodus 40 referring to a veil, altars, sacred clothing, washings, and anointings. How does the temple help us come unto Christ? What can we do to focus our time in the temple on Him? </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we can be forgiven. </subheading>
<p> Although the idea of animal sacrifice may seem strange to us today, there is much we can learn from this practice about the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. To begin a discussion, you could display pictures of the Savior in Gethsemane and on the cross (see Gospel Art Book, nos. 56, 57). Class members could share words that they feel relate to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. Then invite class members to review Leviticus 1:1&#8211;9 or Leviticus 16, which describe animal sacrifices, and find words that they feel also relate to the Savior's sacrifice. How can these ancient sacrifices help us better understand the Atonement of Jesus Christ? Class members could sing a hymn about the Savior and share their feelings about Him. </p>

<p> It may be helpful for class members to compare sacrifices the Lord required in Old Testament times with the sacrifices He asks of us today. For example, they could list ways we make sacrifices for the Lord and His work, such as serving in callings, paying fast offerings, doing family history work, or ministering to each other. Then you could read together Leviticus 1:1&#8211;9 and invite class members to look for elements of the offerings described in these verses that could relate to offerings the Lord asks us to give today (see 3 Nephi 9:19&#8211;20; Doctrine and Covenants 64:34). What can we learn from Moses 5:7 about how we should view our sacrifices for the Lord's work? </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> God can make us holy. </subheading>
<p> President Henry B. Eyring taught: </p>
<p> "Greater happiness comes from greater personal holiness. . . . The scriptures teach us that among other things, we can be sanctified or become more holy when we exercise faith in Christ, demonstrate our obedience, repent, sacrifice for Him, receive sacred ordinances, and keep our covenants with Him. . . . </p>
<p> "The hymn 'More Holiness Give Me' [Hymns, no. 131] suggests a way to pray for help in becoming more holy. The author wisely suggests that the holiness we seek is a gift from a loving God, granted over time, after all we can do" ("Holiness and the Plan of Happiness," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 100&#8211;101, 103). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Use sacred music. </b> The messages in hymns can reinforce the doctrine in the scriptures. For instance, singing a hymn like "More Holiness Give Me" or "I Stand All Amazed" (Hymns, nos. 131, 193) could reinforce some of the messages taught in Leviticus 16 and 19. </p>

<p> Reading Numbers 12 can help class members understand the seriousness of speaking against the Lord's prophet. You could invite class members to read this chapter and talk about how the Lord feels about His servants. Based on verses 1&#8211;2, what do you think it means to speak against the Lord's prophet? What are the dangers of doing so? What can we learn from the actions of Moses and the Israelites in verses 13 and 15? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> NUMBERS 12:3 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Moses was very meek." </subheading>
<p> Some people might be surprised to read that a leader as mighty as Moses, who stood before Pharaoh and performed stunning miracles with the Lord's power, was also "very meek." You could use Numbers 12:3 to begin a discussion about what true meekness is. You might refer to the definition in "Meek, Meekness" in Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). As a class, you could also look for indications of Moses's meekness in Numbers 12. </p>
<p> What other evidences of Moses's meekness can we learn from? (see, for example, Exodus 18:13&#8211;25; Numbers 11:26&#8211;29; Hebrews 11:24&#8211;27; Moses 1:10&#8211;11).

<p> As you discuss the story about the 12 Israelites scouting out the promised land and giving their report, consider asking class members how they feel this story could apply to situations they face. To help, you could invite class members to list things from Numbers 13:23&#8211;33 that could be compared to something in our lives. For example, the promised land might represent something the Lord wants us to accomplish, the clusters of grapes could be blessings, the giants could be the challenges we'll face, and so on. Encourage class members to share what they feel the Lord might want them to learn from this story. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> If we look to Jesus Christ in faith, He can heal us spiritually. </subheading>
<p> To help class members discuss the account in Numbers 21:4&#8211;9 and build their faith in the Savior, you could write questions like these on the board: <i> What does the brass serpent represent? What might the snakebites represent? Why did some people refuse to look upon the brass serpent? How can we "look upon" it today? </i> Class members could share answers they find as they read Numbers 21:4&#8211;9; 1 Nephi 17:40&#8211;41; Alma 33:18&#8211;22; Helaman 8:13&#8211;15. What are some of the simple things the Savior invites us to do to receive His healing? Why is it sometimes hard to do such simple things? (see "Additional Resources" for some thoughts on this). Perhaps class members could share how doing these things has brought the Savior's power into their lives. </p>

<p> Elder L. Whitney Clayton told of a bishop who counseled ward members facing a variety of difficult challenges in their lives: </p>
<p> "His counsel to ward members very often included getting back to simple practices of faith, such as studying the Book of Mormon [&#8321;] . . . paying tithing, and serving in the Church with devotion. Frequently, however, their response to him was one of skepticism: . . . What does doing any of <i> those </i> things have to do with the issues <i> I'm </i> facing?' </p>
<p> ". . . Those who are deliberate about doing the 'small and simple things' [Alma 37:6] &#8212; obeying in seemingly little ways &#8212; are blessed with faith and strength that go far beyond the actual acts of obedience themselves and, in fact, may seem totally unrelated to them" ("Whatsoever He Saith unto You, Do It," Ensign or Liahona, May 2017, 98). </p>

<p> Moses was inspired to teach the children of Israel based on their needs (see Deuteronomy 6:1). As you study Deuteronomy, seek inspiration to know what principles to teach, based on class members' needs. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Because Deuteronomy contains Moses's final words to the children of Israel, you might invite class members to share something they found in Deuteronomy that they would want to include in their final words to their children or grandchildren. As they share, ask them to explain why they chose those words. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord wants us to love Him with all our hearts. </subheading>
<p> Throughout Deuteronomy, there are passages that can prompt us to think about the spiritual condition of our hearts. To help class members share their thoughts about these passages, you could draw a heart on the board. Then divide the following scriptures among class members: Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;7, 20&#8211;25; 8:2&#8211;5, 11&#8211;17; 29:18&#8211;20; 30:6&#8211;10, 15&#8211;20. Invite class members to write the reference inside the heart if it teaches about something we should have in our hearts or to write the reference outside the heart if it teaches something we should avoid. What does it mean to devote our whole hearts to Heavenly Father? </p>
<p> How do we explain to our family and others why we obey God's commandments? After pondering this question, class members could read Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;7, 20&#8211;25 or the statement in "Additional Resources" and share their thoughts. How do these insights affect the way we feel about commandments or covenants? </p>

<p> Sometimes it helps to hear ideas about ways others are teaching and learning the gospel in their homes. Discussing how class members are following the counsel in Deuteronomy 6:4&#8211;9, 20&#8211;25 can give your class an opportunity to learn from each other. What do we do to teach and "talk of" (verse 7) the word of God as these verses describe? What experiences can we share in which the Lord guided us in our efforts? </p>

<p> We haven't yet arrived at the day "when there shall be no poor among you" (Deuteronomy 15:4), so the principles about helping the poor in Deuteronomy 15 are still valuable, even if the particular practices regarding debts and servants have changed. You could invite class members to review verses 1&#8211;15 and find principles about helping the poor and needy that they would like to discuss. Questions like these could help the discussion: What does it mean to "open thine hand wide" to those in need? (verses 8, 11). What role does our heart play in helping others? (see verses 7, 9&#8211;10). What can we learn about helping the needy from the Lord's example? (see verse 15). </p>

<p> It might be interesting to compare Moses's words in Deuteronomy with some of Lehi's final teachings to his family in 2 Nephi 1&#8211;4. Perhaps class members could find similarities and differences between these passages: Deuteronomy 29:9 and 2 Nephi 4:4; Deuteronomy 30:15&#8211;20 and 2 Nephi 2:26&#8211;29. How did Lehi expand on what Moses taught? Why are words like <i> life </i> and <i> death </i> a good way to describe our choices to "keep" or "turn away" from God's commandments? (Deuteronomy 30:16&#8211;17). Class members could share what they find in these passages that inspires them to "choose life" (Deuteronomy 30:19). </p>

Perhaps class members would benefit from discussing what the Lord means by this phrase. They could search Joshua 1:1&#8211;9 for counsel the Lord gave Joshua to help him be strong and courageous. They could also share examples of people they know of who have these traits. How did Joshua show strength and courage in the accounts found in the book of Joshua?

Then, as a class, they could discuss any details that stood out to them. What do we learn from this story that can help us experience the "wonders" of the Lord in our lives? (verse 5). What "wonders" has He done for us? Why is it important that each generation have spiritual experiences that teach them that "the Lord. . . is mighty"? (Joshua 4:24). </p>
<p> Even though we all need to have our own faith-building experiences, remembering what the Lord has done for our ancestors is also important.

<p> Examining Israel's cycle of rebellion, sorrow, repentance, and deliverance can help class members recognize God's power of deliverance in their own lives. Class members could work in small groups to find the cycle described in Judges 2:11&#8211;19; 3:5&#8211;12. How were the children of Israel delivered from their cycle of sin and suffering? What do we learn from the book of Judges about how we can escape from sin and suffering? What are some ways God delivers us? You could also invite class members to find and share scriptures that testify of the Lord as our Deliverer and Redeemer (for example, 2 Samuel 22:1&#8211;3; Psalm 40:16&#8211;17; 1 Nephi 1:19&#8211;20; Mosiah 23:21&#8211;23; Doctrine and Covenants 138:23). </p>
<p> Judges 2:19 records that the Israelites repeatedly turned away from God toward idolatry. Perhaps class members could summarize this verse in the form of a warning for themselves. In what ways do we sometimes "bow down" to "other gods"? How can the Lord help us change our "stubborn way"? </p>
<p> To begin a discussion about how Deborah and Barak delivered Israel from the Canaanites, you could ask a class member to summarize the story for the class (it might help to contact the class member a few days in advance so he or she can be prepared). The class could talk about qualities Deborah had that impress them. How did Deborah inspire the children of Israel to follow the Lord? Perhaps you could read together Judges 4:14 and discuss the meaning of Deborah's faithful declaration: "Is not the Lord gone out before thee?" How does the Lord go out before us?

But as Samson grew, he looked more to the world's temptations than to God's direction. He made choices because they 'pleaseth [him] well' [Judges 14:3] rather than because those choices were right. Repeatedly, the scriptures use the phrase 'and he went down' [Judges 14:7] as they tell of Samson's journeys, actions, and choices. Instead of arising and shining forth to fulfill his great potential, Samson was overcome by the world, lost his God-given power, and died a tragic, early death" ("Arise and Shine Forth," Ensign or Liahona, May 2012, 118). </p>

On the board, you could write questions like these: <i> What trials were Ruth or Hannah facing? How did they show their trust in the Lord during their trials? </i> The groups could look for answers to one or more of the questions and share what they find. What do we learn from these accounts about how the Lord can help us in our trials? </p>

<p> Not everyone who prays for a child receives one, and not everyone whose spouse dies remarries. But our personal challenges, no matter what they are, can be opportunities to turn to the Savior and strengthen our faith in Him. You might ask class members to read Ruth 2:11&#8211;12 and 1 Samuel 1:9&#8211;11 and talk about how Ruth's and Hannah's trials affected their relationships with the Lord. Class members could also share how their own faith was strengthened because they turned to Jesus Christ during times of trial. To support this discussion, you could invite one or more class members to come prepared to share insights from one of the following: Sister Reyna I. Aburto's message "Thru Cloud and Sunshine, Lord, Abide with Me!" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 57&#8211;60); the section titled "The Joy of Overcoming through Christ" from Elder D. Todd Christofferson's message "The Joy of the Saints" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 16&#8211;17); or President Elaine S. Dalton's words in "Additional Resources." Ask class members to share what they learned about how our trials can be opportunities for greater faith in Jesus Christ. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> We should listen to and obey the voice of the Lord. </subheading>
<p> There may be people in your class who, like Samuel, have heard the Lord's voice but did not recognize it as His. You might invite class members to review 1 Samuel 3, looking for what Samuel did that could help us in our efforts to hear and obey the Lord's voice. You might also ask two class members to reenact the interactions between Samuel and Eli. </p>
<p> Sometimes we find ourselves in a situation like Eli's &#8212; we have an opportunity to help someone recognize the voice of the Lord. Perhaps class members could share how they have done this for friends, family members, or others. What scriptures or experiences have we shared to help others understand how the Lord communicates with us? (see, for example, Doctrine and Covenants 6:22&#8211;23; 8:2&#8211;3; 9:7&#8211;9). </p>

<p> "Life's journey sometimes takes us on unexpected paths. There are twists and turns in the road that none of us can anticipate. But with each of these twists and turns there is also opportunity &#8212; opportunity to choose our response and our plan of action. Difficulties in life can be opportunities to help us draw closer to the Savior and to trust in Him more fully. In the process of living close to Him each day, we develop Christlike attributes and qualities. . . . </p>
<p> "Like Ruth and Hannah, all of us will experience adversity. We may not always understand the Lord's design for our lives, but it is my testimony that we are never alone. He is ever with us, and He promises us, 'Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, for the present time, the design of your God concerning those things which shall come hereafter, and the glory which shall follow after much tribulation' [Doctrine and Covenants 58:3]" ("Lessons from Ruth and Hannah," Ensign, Apr. 2006, 35, 37). </p>

It's OK to say "I don't know." While you should try your best to answer questions your class members have, the Lord doesn't expect you to know everything.

Consider asking the class to share what they learned from this activity. In particular, what did they learn about David? </p> 
<p type="bullet"> Some members of your class are likely facing challenges that may seem as daunting as Goliath did to Saul and his army. How can you use the story of David and Goliath to help class members face their challenges with faith in the Lord? Perhaps you could display a picture of David and Goliath (such as the one in this week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> ). Class members could then list on the board some things that might be "Goliaths" in our day. Then they could find verses in 1 Samuel 17 that demonstrate David's faith, which enabled him to defeat Goliath (see also the statement in "Additional Resources"). Perhaps class members could share experiences in which they felt the Lord helping to fight their battles. </p>

You have the stones of virtue and honor and integrity to use against these enemies who would like to conquer you. Insofar as you are concerned, you can hit them 'between the eyes,' to use a figurative expression. You can triumph over them by disciplining yourselves to avoid them. You can say to the whole lot of them as David said to Goliath, 'Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied' 1 Samuel 17:45]" ("Overpowering the Goliaths in Our Lives," Ensign, May 1983, 46, 51). </p>

Perhaps the class could read together 2 Samuel 11:1&#8211;17 and identify choices that David made that led him to sin. What could David have done differently? You could also ask class members to write down a sentence that could help inspire someone to avoid sin, based on what they've learned from 2 Samuel 11. Invite a few class members to share their ideas. </p>
<p> You might use 2 Samuel 11 to discuss the dangers of pornography and other sexual sins. To do this, the class could review together portions of Elder L. Whitney Clayton's message "Blessed Are All the Pure in Heart" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 51&#8211;53). What counsel does Elder Clayton give about the dangers of pornography? You could also watch the video "To Look Upon" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). How can the Savior help us overcome these temptations or behaviors? </p>
<p> Perhaps class members could share ideas they've found helpful in their efforts to protect their families from pornography or overcome the effects of pornography. Sister Linda S. Reeves's message "Protection from Pornography &#8212; a Christ-Focused Home" can help (Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 15&#8211;17; see also "Additional Resources"). </p>

<p> The example of the widow of Zarephath may inspire members of your class during times when their faith is tested. You might start by asking them to list choices that require faith in Jesus Christ. Then they could read the account in 1 Kings 17:8&#8211;16 and talk about what this story teaches them about exercising faith. Encourage class members to share their feelings about the widow and how her example inspires them to exercise their faith. How is her faith similar to the faith Elisha demonstrated in 1 Kings 19:19&#8211;21? Perhaps class members would be willing to share sacrifices they have made for the Lord and how He has blessed them. </p>
<p> The story of the widow of Zarephath can also teach us about the blessings that come from sacrifice. You could ask class members to ponder how they would respond to statements like these: "I can't afford to pay tithing" or "I'm too busy to accept a ministering assignment." What does 1 Kings 17:8&#8211;16 teach us that might apply to these statements? How does our knowledge of the Savior help us when we are asked to make sacrifices? Elder Lynn G.

After reviewing the story with the class, you could write on the board the question Elijah asked the people of Israel: "How long halt ye between two opinions?" (verse 21). Let class members share what they feel this question means. What are some reasons the people might have been "halting" (which can mean hesitating, wavering, or limping) between following the Lord and following Baal?

<p> To help prompt discussion about the phrase "still small voice," you could display objects (or pictures of objects) that might help class members ponder the phrase. Class members could suggest other examples. Why are the words "still" and "small" good ways to describe the voice of the Spirit? For other descriptions, class members could read scriptures like Helaman 5:30; 3 Nephi 11:3&#8211;7; Doctrine and Covenants 6:22&#8211;23; 8:2&#8211;3; 9:8&#8211;9; 11:12&#8211;14; 36:2.

As the Lord's servant, Elijah was there to give, not to take [see 1 Kings 17:13&#8211;16]. . . . One reason the Lord illustrates doctrines with the most extreme circumstances is to eliminate excuses.

<subheading type="ref"> 2 KINGS 2&#8211;6 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> God can work miracles in our lives. </subheading>
<p> As you discuss the miracles in 2 Kings 2&#8211;6, it might be helpful to ask class members to define the word miracle. You might share this insight from President Howard W. Hunter: "[Miracles] are the manifestations of [God's] power which we are helpless to explain or to fully understand. . . . These signs and marvels were most evident in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ, the very Son of God himself. But startling and wonder-filled as they were, Christ's many miracles were only reflections of those greater marvels which his Father had performed before him and continues to perform all around us. . . . There will always be plenty of miracles if we have eyes to see and ears to hear" ("The God That Doest Wonders," Ensign, May 1989, 15&#8211;16). How do these insights help us see God's hand in our lives? </p>
<p> Consider asking class members to list some of the miracles described in 2 Kings 2&#8211;6. What do we learn about the Lord from these miracles? Class members might also be willing to talk about miracles &#8212; big or small &#8212; that they or their families have experienced. How can we better recognize God's miracles in our lives &#8212; including those that are different from what we hoped for? </p>
<p> Class members might find it inspiring to compare some of the miracles Elisha performed with some that Jesus Christ performed (see 2 Kings 4:8&#8211;37 and Luke 7:11&#8211;16; 2 Kings 4:42&#8211;44 and John 6:1&#8211;13; 2 Kings 5:1&#8211;15 and Luke 17:11&#8211;19).

Class members could search 2 Kings 5:1&#8211;19 and write on the board phrases that illustrate Naaman's pride or humility. How are we sometimes like Naaman? How are we sometimes like his servants? How have we come to know what Naaman came to know? </p>
<p> Another lesson we can learn from this story is the value of obeying God in small things. You might start by reading 2 Kings 5:9&#8211;12 and asking for class members' thoughts about why Naaman "went away in a rage" (verse 12). Why do we sometimes prefer doing "some great thing" God asks of us, rather than simple things? (verse 13). What is the value of doing these simple things? </p>

<p> You could invite a class member to come to class prepared to summarize the conversation that the Assyrians had with Hezekiah's officials near the walls of Jerusalem (see 2 Kings 18:17&#8211;36). Before he or she tells the story, invite class members to imagine that they are residents of Jerusalem listening to this conversation. What thoughts or feelings might they have? What might they do? You could give class members portions of Elder David A. Bednar's message "Therefore They Hushed Their Fears" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 46&#8211;49) and invite them to look for counsel that could sustain them during times of fear or doubt. How has our faith in Jesus Christ sustained us during challenging times? </p>

<p> Discussing the power the word of God had in the lives of King Josiah and his people can inspire class members to seek that same power in their own lives. You could begin a discussion by inviting class members to imagine how their lives might be different if they did not have the scriptures. Then they could search 2 Kings 22:8&#8211;11; 23:1&#8211;6, 21, 24 to find out how Josiah and his people changed when they heard the word of God from scriptures that had been recently rediscovered in the temple. How have the scriptures helped us come closer to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ? </p>
<p> The dramatic changes that the word of God had on Josiah and many people in his kingdom could inspire your class members to seek similar changes in their lives. After discussing these changes (see 2 Kings 23:1&#8211;6, 21, 24), class members could share experiences in which a scripture passage or account made a difference in their lives. Perhaps they could talk about why they were receptive to the message of that scripture at that time in their lives. The statement in "Additional Resources" may add to your discussion. </p>

<p> President Spencer W. Kimball said: </p>
<p> "I am convinced that each of us, at some time in our lives, must discover the scriptures for ourselves &#8212; and not just discover them once, but rediscover them again and again. . </p>
<p> "I feel strongly that we must all of us return to the scriptures just as King Josiah did and let them work mightily within us, impelling us to an unwavering determination to serve the Lord. . . . </p>
<p> "I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel" (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 62&#8211;63, 67). </p>

<p> The books of Ezra and Nehemiah describe people accomplishing important work despite opposition from their enemies. To begin a discussion, you might ask class members what Nehemiah's "great work" (Nehemiah 6:3) could be compared to in our lives. What important work has God given us to do? Then you could read Ezra 4:4 and discuss how Satan tries to weaken our hands and trouble us in doing God's work. What do we learn from Nehemiah and his fellow workers in Nehemiah 2:18&#8211;20; 4:6&#8211;9; and 6:1&#8211;3? What does it mean to have "a mind to work" in the service of the Savior? (Nehemiah 4:6). Consider sharing part of President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's message "We Are Doing a Great Work and Cannot Come Down" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2009, 59&#8211;62), especially the last two sections. </p>
<p> You may feel inspired to lead a discussion comparing Zerubbabel's efforts to rebuild the temple to our efforts to attend the temple and do saving work there. For example, you could write two headings on the board: <i> Zerubbabel </i> and <i> Us </i> . Under <i> Zerubbabel </i> , class members could write what "the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin" (Ezra 4:1) did to try to stop Zerubbabel and the Jewish people from rebuilding the temple (see Ezra 4). Under <i> Us </i> , class members could list ways the adversary tries to stop us from attending the temple.

<p> To help members of your class think about how the Lord has prepared them "for such a time as this" (Esther 4:14), invite them to read Esther 4:10&#8211;17. How might Mordecai's words to Esther have helped her make the decision to defend her people? Just as God placed Esther in a position where she could save the Jews, what are some situations He places us in so we can bless others? How can we become better instruments in His hands?

<p> The first two chapters of Job, which describe Satan questioning the reasons behind Job's faithfulness, could help class members evaluate their own reasons for being faithful to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Class members might start by listing some reasons a person might choose to obey God's commandments. They could then search Job 1:6&#8211;12; 2:1&#8211;6 to find out what Satan said about Job's faithfulness. Why would it be dangerous to obey the Lord solely for the reason Satan suggested? What does Job's response in Job 1:20&#8211;22; 2:9&#8211;10 reveal about Job? Class members could talk about why they choose to remain faithful to God. </p>
<graphics-caption> Job, by Gary L. Kapp </graphics-caption>
<p> While Job had times when he struggled with doubt and despair, ultimately his trust in the Lord sustained him in his suffering. To learn from Job's example, class members could search some of the following verses to identify some of Job's positive responses to his trials: Job 1:21; 2:10; 12:9&#8211;10, 16; 13:15&#8211;16; 19:23&#8211;27. What can we learn from these responses that can help us be spiritually strong when we face trials? Why is it dangerous to assume that trials are punishments for sin? </p>
<p> Job's declaration in Job 19:23&#8211;27 could inspire class members to ponder and share their own conviction that the Redeemer, Jesus Christ, lives. You might start by inviting class members to quietly ponder Job's words in these verses. They could then discuss questions like these: Why is a testimony of our Redeemer so valuable during times of trial like those Job suffered? How has our testimony sustained us in our trials? Singing or reading the lyrics of a hymn about Jesus Christ, such as "I Know That My Redeemer Lives" (Hymns, no. 136), could add insight and spiritual power to your discussion. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> JOB 38 </subheading>

<p> Much of the book of Job (chapters 3&#8211;37) involves Job and his friends wrestling with the question "Why do bad things happen to righteous people?" While the Lord does not answer this question completely in the book of Job, He does provide an important message. You could help class members discover this message by inviting them to read the questions the Lord asked Job in Job 38:1&#8211;7, 18&#8211;24. What do we learn from these questions? </p>
<p> The restored gospel of Jesus Christ provides additional light that can help us understand some of the reasons for suffering in the world. Class members could share truths they know because of the Restoration of the gospel that have given them greater perspective and understanding about suffering.

But if we look upon life as an eternal thing stretching far into the premortal past and on into the eternal post-death future, then all happenings may be put in proper perspective. </p>
<p> "Is there not wisdom in [God's] giving us trials that we might rise above them, responsibilities that we might achieve, work to harden our muscles, sorrows to try our souls? Are we not exposed to temptations to test our strength, sickness that we might learn patience, death that we might be immortalized and glorified? . . . </p>
<p> "If joy and peace and rewards were instantaneously given the doer of good, there could be no evil &#8212; all would do good but not because of the rightness of doing good.

<p type="bullet"> This week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> suggests reading Psalms 1; 23; 26&#8211;28; 46 and looking for the following: </p>
<ul>
<li> Invitations to trust the Lord </li>
<li> Words that describe the Lord </li>
<li> Words that describe the peace, strength, and other blessings He provides </li>
<li> Words that describe those who trust Him </li>
</ul>
<p type="u-bullet"> You might write these phrases on the board and invite class members to write, next to each phrase, something they found in Psalms 1; 23; 26&#8211;28; or 46.

Class members could share the feelings they had about the Savior as they read these psalms. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Because the Psalms were like hymns for the Israelites, you might invite class members to suggest hymns that remind them of psalms they read this week. They could refer to the "Scriptures" index at the end of the hymnbook for ideas (see also the list in "Additional Resources"). Class members could sing a few of these hymns and identify common themes in the hymns and the psalms. What messages of peace and faith in Jesus Christ do we find? </p>

<p type="bullet"> Reading the Psalms &#8212; especially those that point to the Savior's life &#8212; can be a great way to strengthen faith in Jesus Christ. You might divide the class into groups of two or more and give each group one of the following pairs of references: Psalm 2:1&#8211;3 and Acts 4:24&#8211;28; Psalm 2:7 and Acts 13:30&#8211;33; Psalm 22:1 and Matthew 27:45&#8211;46; Psalm 22:7&#8211;8 and Matthew 27:39&#8211;43; Psalm 22:16 and Luke 23:32&#8211;33; Psalm 22:18 and Matthew 27:35; Psalm 31:5 and Luke 23:46. Ask each group to find how a prophecy in the Psalms was fulfilled in the Savior's life and discuss how these scriptures strengthen their testimony of the Savior. </p>
<p> Or you could write the scripture references on the board and invite class members to match a passage from Psalms with the corresponding event in the New Testament. </p>
<p> You might also invite class members to share other references to the Savior that they found in their study of the Psalms (such as Psalms 34:20; 41:9; see also Luke 24:44). </p>
<p> After class members discuss these scriptures, they could talk about why these psalms would have been meaningful to Jews who knew the Savior. Why are they meaningful to us? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> PSALM 23 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "The Lord is my shepherd." </subheading> 
<p type="bullet"> To help class members discuss the imagery and symbolism in Psalm 23, consider showing pictures that relate to the ideas in the psalm, such as those in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families. </i> You could then ask class members to identify meaningful words or phrases in the psalm and discuss what they might represent. For example, what do phrases like "lie down in green pastures" or "still waters" bring to mind? What could the comforting "rod" and "staff" symbolize? What might it mean for our "cup" to run over? What do these symbols teach us about Jesus Christ? You might suggest that class members restate the psalm, replacing some of the symbols with possible meanings the class discussed. </p>

Invite class members to share their thoughts, and encourage them to find passages in Psalms 51; 85&#8211;86 that describe the effect of His cleansing forgiveness in our lives (for example, see Psalms 51:1&#8211;2, 7&#8211;12; 85:2&#8211;9). Consider displaying pictures or objects to help class members visualize these phrases. Class members could then share their feelings about the Savior Jesus Christ and His willingness to atone for our sins so we can be forgiven. You might also sing together a hymn about the Savior's atoning sacrifice, such as "I Stand All Amazed" (Hymns, no. 193). </p>
<p> In order to repent, we need faith not only that Jesus Christ <i> can </i> cleanse us but also that He <i> will </i> . Class members may have found passages in Psalms 51; 85&#8211;86 this week that strengthened their faith in the Lord's willingness to forgive. Encourage them to share what they found. You could also point them to Psalm 86:5, 13, 15 and ask what these verses teach about the Lord. What could it mean that He is "plenteous in mercy and truth"? (verse 15). Why is it important for us to know this? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> PSALM 66:5&#8211;20 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Our testimony of Jesus Christ can help others come unto Him. </subheading>
<p> One of the great blessings of meeting together in Sunday School is the opportunity to gain strength from the faith and testimonies of other followers of Jesus Christ. To provide this opportunity for your class, you could ask class members to read Psalm 66:16 and ponder this question: If you were to "declare what [the Lord] hath done for [your] soul," what would you declare? As they ponder, they could read verses 5&#8211;20 for ideas. Let them write down their answers. Then invite them to "declare" to each other &#8212; in small groups or to the whole class &#8212; what Jesus Christ has done for their souls. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Repentance means change. </subheading>
<p> President Russell M. Nelson described repentance in this way: </p>
<p> "When Jesus asks you and me to 'repent,' He is inviting us to change our mind, our knowledge, our spirit &#8212; even the way we breathe. He is asking us to change the way we love, think, serve, spend our time, treat our wives, teach our children, and even care for our bodies. </p>
<p> "Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance. Repentance is not an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind. When coupled with faith, repentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. . . . </p>
<p> "When we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy &#8212; the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent, we choose to become more like Jesus Christ!" ("We Can Do Better and Be Better," Ensign or Liahona, May 2019, 67). </p>

<subheading type="ref"> PSALM 119 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> God's word will keep us on His path. </subheading>
<p> To begin a discussion about Psalm 119, you might invite class members to talk about a time when they followed a path to reach a destination (it may help to contact someone in advance and ask him or her to be prepared to talk about this). What experiences made it difficult to stay on the path? What helped them stay on it? You might then draw a path on the board and invite class members to write phrases from Psalm 119 that tell what the Lord has done to help us stay on His covenant path. Consider sharing the quotation by President Russell M. Nelson in "Additional Resources" as part of your discussion. </p>
<p> Members of your class may benefit from comparing what Psalm 119 teaches about staying on the Lord's path with other scriptures that teach similar truths. Consider dividing the class into groups and asking each group to review scripture passages like these: Psalm 119:33&#8211;40, 105; Proverbs 4:11&#8211;19; 1 Nephi 8:20&#8211;28; 11:25; 2 Nephi 31:17&#8211;21; Alma 7:9, 19&#8211;20.

<subheading type="ref"> PSALM 139 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord knows our hearts. </subheading>
<p> Understanding that the Lord is aware of us&#8213;our thoughts and actions, strengths and weaknesses &#8212; and that He loves us can have a powerful influence on the choices we make. You could invite the class to look for phrases in Psalm 139 that teach this important truth. How are our lives affected by knowing this truth?

<heading type="title"> "THE FEAR OF THE LORD IS THE BEGINNING OF WISDOM" </heading>
<p> How might the messages in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes bless the lives of those you teach? Follow the promptings and impressions you receive as you study and prepare to teach. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> There are many beautiful and powerful messages in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. Before discussing specific passages, such as those suggested below, invite class members to share some of their favorites from their personal or family scripture study this week. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> PROVERBS 1&#8211;4; 15&#8211;16; ECCLESIASTES 1&#8211;3; 11&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Incline thine ear unto wisdom." </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> The invitation to seek wisdom and understanding is repeated throughout Proverbs. How can you help class members share what they learned about wisdom during their study? One way might be to write <i> wisdom </i> on the board and invite class members to add verse numbers or phrases from Proverbs or Ecclesiastes that they feel provide insights about wisdom. (If it would be helpful, you might suggest that class members search Proverbs 1&#8211;4; 15&#8211;16; Ecclesiastes 1&#8211;3; 11&#8211;12.) What do we learn about wisdom from these scriptures? How are we blessed when we seek wisdom from God? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> PROVERBS 1:7; 2:5; 3:7; 8:13; 15:33; 16:6; 31:30; ECCLESIASTES 12:13 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord." </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Another theme found throughout Proverbs and Ecclesiastes is "the fear of the Lord" (Proverbs 1:7; see also Proverbs 2:5; 3:7; 8:13; 15:33; 16:6; 31:30; Ecclesiastes 12:13). Perhaps class members could read some of these verses and share what they feel it means to fear the Lord. How is fear of the Lord different from other kinds of fear? You could share insights from Elder David A. Bednar's explanation found in "Additional Resources." </p>
<graphics-caption> Learning to Trust the Lord, by Kathleen Peterson </graphics-caption>
<subheading type="ref"> PROVERBS 3:5&#8211;7 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart." </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Class members might enjoy an object lesson that helps them understand what it means to "trust in the Lord" and "lean not unto [their] own understanding" (Proverbs 3:5). For example, you could invite a class member to lean against something sturdy and stable, like a wall. Then the person could try leaning against something that is not sturdy, like a broom. How does this demonstration help us understand Proverbs 3:5? What does Proverbs 3:5&#8211;7 teach about what it means to trust in the Lord? Why is it unwise to lean on our own understanding? How have we felt the Lord direct our paths as we have trusted Him? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> PROVERBS 15:1&#8211;2, 4, 18, 28; 16:24&#8211;32 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "A soft answer turneth away wrath." </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> To help class members discuss how they can have more peace and less contention in their lives, you could invite them to read Proverbs 15:1&#8211;2, 18; 16:32. Then they could share experiences they have had that illustrate the truths in these verses. For example, when has using "a soft answer" helped to "[turn] away wrath"? (Proverbs 15:1). Or they could think of times when the Savior exemplified what is taught in these verses (see John 8:1&#8211;11; 18:1&#8211;11). How can we follow His example as we interact with others? </p> 
<p type="bullet"> While the writers of Proverbs didn't know about the many communication channels that exist in our day, the counsel in Proverbs 15 and 16 can apply to all forms of communication. To help class members understand this, you could invite each person to pick one of the following scriptures to read: Proverbs 15:1&#8211;2, 4, 18, 28; 16:24, 27&#8211;30. Class members could then restate their proverb in the form of advice about interacting with others over social media, through texting, or online. They can find additional helpful counsel in "Language" in <i> For the Strength of Youth </i> (2011), 20&#8211;21. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Godly fear is loving and trusting in Him." </subheading>
<p> Elder David A. Bednar explained: </p>
<p> "Godly fear grows out of a correct understanding of the divine nature and mission of the Lord Jesus Christ, a willingness to submit our will to His will, and a knowledge that every man and woman will be accountable for his or her own sins in the Day of Judgment. . . . </p>
<p> "Godly fear is loving and trusting in Him. As we fear God more completely, we love Him more perfectly. And 'perfect love casteth out all fear' (Moroni 8:16). I promise the bright light of godly fear will chase away the dark shadows of mortal fears (see Doctrine and Covenants 50:25) as we look to the Savior, build upon Him as our foundation, and press forward on His covenant path with consecrated commitment" ("Therefore They Hushed Their Fears," Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 48&#8211;49). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Focus on Jesus Christ. </b> There is no better way to increase the faith of those you teach than by centering your lesson on the Savior. Through your teaching, invite class members to build "upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God" (Helaman 5:12). </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> This week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> gives ideas for understanding the writings of Isaiah. You could invite class members to share how one of these ideas, or something else, helped them learn from Isaiah 1&#8211;12. </p>

<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 1&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The words of Isaiah will all be fulfilled. </subheading>
<p> Speaking of Isaiah, the Savior taught that "all things that he spake have been and shall be, even according to the words which he spake" (3 Nephi 23:3). You might start a discussion about Isaiah by sharing this scripture and the statement in "Additional Resources." You could then write on the board <i> Isaiah's day, The Savior's mortal ministry, </i> and <i> The latter days. </i> Class members could look for passages in Isaiah 1&#8211;12 that might apply to one or more of the phrases on the board (for example, Isaiah 2:1&#8211;5; 7:1&#8211;7; 7:10&#8211;14; 9:2&#8211;7; 10:20; 11:10; 12:1). Why is it a blessing to have these prophecies available to us today? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 1; 3; 5 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Cease to do evil." </subheading>
You might ask class members to share what they learned from their personal and family study of Isaiah 1, 3, 5 about the spiritual condition of the Kingdom of Judah in the days of Isaiah. Perhaps they could review these chapters and create a list of verses and the conditions they describe. What messages of hope did we find in these chapters? (If needed, you could refer class members to Isaiah 1:16&#8211;20, 25&#8211;27; 3:10.) If ancient Judah had a message for us, what might it be?
<p> Class members could pretend that they were living in Jerusalem when Isaiah prophesied. You could interview a few of them, asking them what Isaiah said and how they felt about it. For example, you might ask class members to talk about Isaiah's words found in Isaiah 1:16&#8211;20; 3:16&#8211;26; 5:20&#8211;23. What did Isaiah say that inspires us to repent? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 2; 4; 11&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> God will do a great work in the latter days. </subheading>
<p> To help class members ponder how Isaiah's prophecies about the last days are being fulfilled, you could select some verses from Isaiah 2; 4; 11&#8211;12 (such as Isaiah 2:2&#8211;3; 4:5&#8211;6). Then ask class members to find the future-tense verbs in these verses (such as "shall be" or "shall go"). Invite them to replace some of these with present-tense verbs (such as "is being" or "are going"). How are these prophecies being fulfilled in our lives? Why is it important to know about these prophecies? </p>
<p> You might point out that when Moroni visited Joseph Smith in 1823, he quoted Isaiah 11 and said that it was about to be fulfilled (see Joseph Smith History 1:40; see also Doctrine and Covenants 113:1&#8211;6). Class members could read a few verses from Isaiah 11 (such as verses 6&#8211;12) and summarize in their own words what Isaiah foresaw. What is our role in fulfilling these prophecies? </p>
<graphics-caption> "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given" (Isaiah 9:6). </graphics-caption>
<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 7&#8211;9 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Isaiah prophesied of Jesus Christ. </subheading>
<p> You might ask class members what they learn about Jesus Christ from passages such as Isaiah 7:14; 8:13&#8211;14; 9:2, 6&#8211;7. For example, why is Immanuel a good title for the Savior? (see Matthew 1:23). How has Jesus Christ been a "Counsellor" or "Prince of Peace" to us? Class members could also share other passages they found in Isaiah 1&#8211;12 that remind them of Jesus Christ. What do these passages teach us about Him? </p>
<p> Before class, you could invite class members to bring a picture of Christ that they feel represents one of the descriptions of the Savior found in Isaiah 7&#8211;9. During class, give them time to show the picture they brought and explain how it relates to Isaiah's words. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Isaiah's prophecies can have multiple fulfillments. </subheading>
<p> President Dallin H. Oaks taught: "The book of Isaiah contains numerous prophecies that seem to have multiple fulfillments. One seems to involve the people of Isaiah's day or the circumstances of the next generation. Another meaning, often symbolic, seems to refer to events in the meridian of time, when Jerusalem was destroyed and her people scattered after the crucifixion of the Son of God. Still another meaning or fulfillment of the same prophecy seems to relate to the events attending the Second Coming of the Savior. The fact that many of these prophecies can have multiple meanings underscores the importance of our seeking revelation from the Holy Ghost to help us interpret them" ("Scripture Reading and Revelation," Ensign, Jan. 1995, 8). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Invite the Spirit. </b> "Sacred music, the scriptures, words of latter-day prophets, expressions of love and testimony, and moments of quiet contemplation can all invite the presence of the Spirit" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 10). </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Apostasy means turning away from the Lord and His prophets. </subheading>
<p> This week's outline in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families suggests pondering some of the metaphors Isaiah used to describe the consequences of turning away from the Lord and rejecting His prophets. Invite class members to share what they learned. Or you could invite them to each review one of the following passages: Isaiah 24:1&#8211;5; 28:7&#8211;8; 29:7&#8211;10; 30:8&#8211;14. Based on what they read, they could complete this sentence: "If we turn away from the Lord, we are like. . ." What can we do to stay faithful to the Lord and avoid apostasy? (See "Additional Resources" for some suggestions.) How does the Lord bless those who stay faithful to Him? </p>
<p> To begin a discussion about the attitudes and behaviors that can lead us to apostasy, you could invite class members to search Isaiah 24:1&#8211;5; 28:1&#8211;8; 29:7&#8211;10; 30:8&#8211;14. Ask them to search for things that people in Isaiah's time were thinking and doing. Make a warning label on the board that says Warning: The following attitudes and behaviors can lead to apostasy. Class members could list on the board what they find in the verses. Give them an opportunity to share how they safeguard themselves or their families from apostasy. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord can restore things that are lost or broken. </subheading>
<p> Here's a question you could write on the board that might help class members ponder Isaiah 29: How do Isaiah's writings relate to the Restoration of the gospel in our day? Encourage them to think about this question as they silently read Isaiah 29:13&#8211;24. If they need help, they could also review passages like these: 2 Nephi 27:6&#8211;26; Joseph Smith &#8212; History 1:17&#8211;19, 63&#8211;65. After they talk about the question on the board, they could discuss why "marvellous" and "wonder" (Isaiah 29:14) are good words to describe the Restoration of the gospel. What do we learn about the Restoration from "The Restoration of the Fulness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ: A Bicentennial Proclamation to the World"? (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). </p>
<p> Chapters 30 and 35 of Isaiah contain several passages that could inspire greater faith in the Lord's power to bless those who turn to Him. To help class members discover these passages, you could invite them to study either Isaiah 30:18&#8211;26 or Isaiah 35. Ask them to share words or phrases they find that could help someone turn to the Lord for redemption. </p>

<p> "We need to experience a continuing conversion by increasing our faith in Jesus Christ and our faithfulness to His gospel throughout our lives &#8212; not just once but regularly [see Alma 5:26]. . . . </p>
<p> ". . . The words of the Lord are found in the scriptures and the teachings of the apostles and prophets. They provide us counsel and direction that, when followed, will act like a spiritual life jacket and will help us know how to hold on with both hands. . . . </p>
<p> "In addition to developing the habit of personal scripture reading, we need to be like the sons of Mosiah and give ourselves 'to much prayer, and fasting' [Alma 17:3]" ("Stay in the Boat and Hold On!" Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2014, 90&#8211;91). </p>

<p> The hymn "How Firm a Foundation" (Hymns, no. 85) draws on Isaiah's words in Isaiah 41:10; 43:2&#8211;5; 46:4. After reading these scriptures and singing relevant verses of the hymn, class members could talk about times they have felt the Lord was with them and how their experiences helped them to "fear not." </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> "Ye are my witnesses." </subheading>
<p> What does it mean to be the Lord's "witnesses"? Class members could ponder this question as they read one or more of the following passages: Isaiah 40:1&#8211;3, 9&#8211;11; 48:20&#8211;21; 49:1&#8211;9. The statement in "Additional Resources" could also provide some answers. What are the "good tidings" that we share as the Lord's witnesses? What in these verses helps us "be not afraid" to share our witness? (Isaiah 40:9). Class members could talk about opportunities they have to be the Lord's witnesses and how their testimonies can bless others. </p>
<p> To help class members apply the teachings in Isaiah 43:8&#8211;13, you could invite them to imagine that they have been called to the witness stand in a court trial. In this trial, Jesus Christ has been charged with making the claim recorded in Isaiah 43:11. If we were called as witnesses in support of Jesus's claim (see verse 10), what testimony could we offer? What evidence from our lives would we present? </p>

Cook help us understand Isaiah 48:10: "Qualities of character and righteousness that are forged in the furnace of affliction perfect and purify us" ("The Songs They Could Not Sing," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2011, 106). They could also talk about how their own "furnace of affliction" has helped refine them spiritually. How does Isaiah 49:13&#8211;16 help us when we are afflicted?

<subheading type="sub-title"> Standing as a witness. </subheading>
<p> President Margaret D. Nadauld explained what it means to "stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places" (Mosiah 18:9): </p>
<p> "In standing as a witness at all times, we promise to love the Lord, to honor Him all the time &#8212; daytime and nighttime, summer and winter, good times and bad times &#8212; love the Lord and let that love show by the way we live. . . . </p>
<p> "Standing as a witness in all things means all things &#8212; big things, little things, in all conversations, in jokes, in games played and books read and music listened to, in causes supported, in service rendered, in clothes worn, in friends made. . . . </p>
<p> "Finally, we say that we will stand as a witness in all places. That means not only in public places but in private places, in secret, in dark or in light places; in church, school, home, or cars; in mountain places or beach places; on the street or in the park. . . . </p>
<p> "When we think of the magnificence of [the Savior's] gift to us, what small thing could we do for Him and for our Heavenly Father who sent Him? We could stand as witnesses of Their love and teachings at all times, in all things, and in all places" ("Stand as a Witness," Ensign, May 2000, 93, 95). </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> To prompt class members to share experiences they had while reading Isaiah 50&#8211;57, you could write on the board a sentence like My faith in Jesus Christ was strengthened when I read. . . Invite class members to share how they would finish the sentence. </p>

<p> We all have times when we feel weak. To help class members rely on the Lord's strength, you could assign them each to read a few verses from Isaiah 51&#8211;52 and share something they find that would strengthen someone who feels weak or discouraged. You might also point out that the resurrected Savior repeated some of Isaiah's words to the people in the Americas (see 3 Nephi 20:32&#8211;45). What do the Savior's words in 3 Nephi 20:30&#8211;34 add to our understanding of when these prophecies will be fulfilled? </p>
<p> This week's outline in Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families suggests listing everything in Isaiah 50&#8211;52 that the Lord invites His people to do. Perhaps class members could share what they found and talk about what these invitations mean to them. You might want to focus on the invitations in Isaiah 51:1&#8211;2, 6&#8211;8; 52:1&#8211;3, 9&#8211;11. How can we act on these invitations? You might point out that Doctrine and Covenants 113:7&#8211;10 provides an inspired explanation of Isaiah 52:1&#8211;2. What do these words add to our understanding? </p>

<p> To help class members visualize Isaiah's words in Isaiah 53, you could display several pictures of the events surrounding the Atonement of Jesus Christ (see Gospel Art Book, nos. 56&#8211;60). You could then ask class members to find phrases in Isaiah 53 that describe the events in the pictures. What do Isaiah's words teach about the Savior's suffering for us? What do they suggest about why He suffered for us? What do these teachings inspire us to do? </p>
<p> To invite the Holy Ghost to testify of the truths taught in Isaiah 52:13&#8211;15; 53, you might ask class members to read these verses silently while you play a recording of a hymn about the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Invite class members to look for words or phrases in the scriptures that they feel are especially important. Then let them share what they found and how they feel about the Savior. Consider also inviting class members to read Mosiah 15:10&#8211;12, where Abinadi explained what is meant by the phrase "his seed." How does this help us understand Isaiah 53:10? </p>

<p> "The joyous news of the gospel is this: because of the eternal plan of happiness provided by our loving Heavenly Father and through the infinite sacrifice of Jesus the Christ, we can not only be redeemed from our fallen state and restored to purity, but we can also transcend mortal imagination and become heirs of eternal life and partakers of God's indescribable glory" ("He Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home," Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 102). </p>

<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> You could invite class members to write on the board the references for verses that inspired them during their scripture study this week. As a class, you could then look up those verses and talk about the truths found there. These insights could lead to deeper discussion of one or more of the principles listed below. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 58:3&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Fasting brings blessings. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> To help class members discuss why and how the Lord has commanded us to fast, you could create two columns on the board labeled <i> "Ye Shall Not Fast as Ye Do This Day" </i> and <i> "The Fast That I Have Chosen." </i> Then class members could read Isaiah 58:3&#8211;7, filling in the first column with descriptions of how the Israelites were fasting and the second column with descriptions of fasting as the Lord intends. How do these descriptions affect the way we view fasting? Class members could also share how, in their experience, fasting leads to the blessings the Lord promised in verses 8&#8211;12. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Some class members might have had experiences explaining to others why we fast. Invite them to share what they said. You could also invite a member of the bishopric to talk about how fast offerings are used. Or you might share an example of how fasting blesses people from President Henry B. Eyring's message "Is Not This the Fast That I Have Chosen?" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2015, 22&#8211;25). How do fasting and paying fast offerings help to "undo the heavy burdens" of ourselves and others? (Isaiah 58:6). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 61:1&#8211;3; 63:7&#8211;9 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Jesus Christ is our Savior and Redeemer. </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> When Jesus Christ announced to the people of Nazareth that He was the Messiah, He quoted from Isaiah 61:1&#8211;3 (see Luke 4:16&#8211;21; see also the video "Jesus Declares He Is the Messiah," ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Perhaps class members could read Isaiah 61:1&#8211;3 and talk about why these verses are a good description of the Savior's mission. You might list on the board each thing the Savior was anointed to do and discuss what each one means. How did the Savior fulfill these aspects of His mission during His mortal life? How has He fulfilled them in our lives? </p>
<p type="bullet"> Class members could also read Isaiah 63:7&#8211;9 and share how Jesus Christ has blessed them in the ways described. </p>
<p type="bullet"> Isaiah 61:1&#8211;3 uses beautiful and poetic language to describe Jesus Christ's power to redeem what seems ruined. To help illustrate these verses, consider sharing a story about something that was thought to be lost or ruined but was turned into something even more beautiful. For examples, see the video "Provo City Center Temple" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also "Additional Resources") or the story at the beginning of President Dieter F. Uchtdorf's message "He Will Place You on His Shoulders and Carry You Home" (Ensign or Liahona, May 2016, 101&#8211;4). Class members could talk about how they have seen the Lord give people something beautiful when they thought their lives were ruined. </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> At His Second Coming, the Lord will "create new heavens and a new earth." </subheading>
<p type="bullet"> Isaiah 65:17&#8211;25 describes conditions on the earth after the Savior's Second Coming. You could invite class members to review these verses searching for answers to questions like these: How will life on the "new earth" be different from the way life currently is on earth? What do you find in these verses that causes you to rejoice? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord "does not leave us in the ashes." </subheading>
<p> After recounting how a fire nearly destroyed the Provo Tabernacle, allowing it to be rebuilt later as the Provo City Center Temple, Sister Linda S. Reeves said: "The Lord allows us to be tried and tested, sometimes to our maximum capacity. We have seen the lives of loved ones &#8212; and maybe our own &#8212; figuratively burned to the ground and have wondered why a loving and caring Heavenly Father would allow such things to happen. But He does not leave us in the ashes; He stands with open arms, eagerly inviting us to come to Him. He is building our lives into magnificent temples where His Spirit can dwell eternally" ("Claim the Blessings of Your Covenants," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 119). </p>

You could also ask them to share how they have helped others come to know this important truth. How does this knowledge bless our lives? Class members could then list on the board things they learn about prophets from Jeremiah 1:4&#8211;19. What do prophets in our day "root out" or "pull down"? What do they "build" and "plant"?

<p type="bullet"> To prompt a discussion about Jeremiah 2:13, you could draw on the board a cistern (a large underground reservoir) and a fountain (like a natural spring). Class members could then read Jeremiah 2:13 and talk about why it is better to get water from a fountain rather than digging a cistern. What might be the spiritual equivalent of making broken cisterns? You could invite class members to read verses from Jeremiah 2 and 7 and share some of the ways the Israelites had forsaken "the fountain of living waters" (see, for example, Jeremiah 2:26&#8211;28; 7:2&#8211;11). Why is "living water" a good symbol for what the Savior gives us? </p>

Invite class members to discuss how meaningful the Exodus was to the Israelites for generations. Class members could then read Jeremiah 16:14&#8211;15 and talk about how the latter-day gathering of Israel will be even more important to God's people (see also Jeremiah 3:14&#8211;18). Class members who reviewed "Hope of Israel" as part of their personal study could share what they learned about the importance of the gathering of Israel (see Russell M. Nelson and Wendy W. Nelson, "Hope of Israel" [worldwide youth devotional, June 3, 2018], supplement to the New Era and Ensign, Aug. 2018, 2&#8211;17, ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Or you could review parts of that message as a class. How is Israel being gathered in our area? </p>

<p> "Your Heavenly Father has known you for long time. You, as His son or daughter, were chosen by Him to come to earth at this precise time, to be a leader in His great work on earth.

<p> Reviewing Jeremiah 31:31&#8211;34; 32:37&#8211;42 can help your class ponder the covenants they have made. One way to encourage a discussion about these verses is to give class members a few minutes to read the verses and then write on a slip of paper a question they would like to ask the class about what they read. For instance, they might want to discuss what it means to have God's law written in our hearts (see Jeremiah 31:33) or how covenants help us to come to know the Lord (see Jeremiah 31:34). You could collect the questions and pick a few to discuss together. What do we learn from these verses that inspires us to be valiant in keeping our covenants? </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> You can always have hope. </subheading>
<p> President M. Russell Ballard mentioned some situations that may cause some to lose hope, and he offered counsel about where to find hope: </p>
<p> "Some of us may find our lives laden with frustration, disappointment, and sorrow. Many feel helpless to deal with the chaos that seems to prevail in the world. Others anguish over family members who are being carried downstream in a swift, raging current of weakening values and declining moral standards. . . .Many have even resigned themselves to accept the wickedness and cruelty of the world as being irreparable. They have given up hope. . . . </p>
<p> ". . . Some among us may have lost all hope because of sin and transgression. A person can become so deeply immersed in the ways of the world that he sees no way out and loses all hope. My plea to all who have fallen into this trap of the adversary is to never give up! Regardless of how desperate things may seem or how desperate they may yet become, please believe me, you can always have hope. Always" ("The Joy of Hope Fulfilled," Ensign, Nov. 1992, 31&#8211;32). </p>
<p> "Quite simply, our one hope for spiritual safety during these turbulent times is to turn our minds and our hearts to Jesus Christ. . . . Faith in God and in His Son, Jesus Christ, is absolutely essential for us to maintain a balanced perspective through times of trial and difficulty" ("The Joy of Hope Fulfilled," 32). </p>

<p> You might feel inspired to ask questions that help class members ponder the symbolism in Ezekiel 34:11&#8211;31. For example, what might the "good pasture" and "good fold" represent in verse 14? What's the difference between a sheep who is "lost" and one who is "driven away"? (verse 16). How does the Savior rescue both kinds of sheep?

How is He accomplishing it? </i> You could then ask half of the class to read Ezekiel 37:1&#8211;14 and the other half to read Ezekiel 37:15&#8211;28 as they search for insights these two passages might provide to the questions on the board. It might help to explain that the sticks of Joseph and Judah mentioned in verses 16&#8211;19 represent the Book of Mormon and Bible. As class members share their answers, encourage them to talk about their role in the latter-day gathering of Israel. </p>

<i> Pictures could help class members understand the vision described in Ezekiel 47:1&#8211;12. For example, you could show a picture of a temple, a river, a desert, and the Dead Sea (see the images in this week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> and Bible Photographs, no. 3, "Judean Wilderness"). It might help to explain that the Dead Sea is so salty that fish and plants can't live in it. Class members could read verses 1&#8211;12 and share what impresses them about the waters described in the vision (see also Revelation 22:1 and the statement in "Additional Resources"). They could also draw pictures of Ezekiel's vision. What might the waters symbolize? What could the trees described in verse 12 represent? Perhaps class members could share how the temple and its blessings have brought them spiritual life and healing. </i>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Temple blessings can heal us. </subheading>
<p> Referring to the water flowing from the temple in Ezekiel's vision (see Ezekiel 47:1&#8211;12), Elder Dale G. Renlund observed: </p>
<p> "Two characteristics of the water are noteworthy. First, though the small stream had no tributaries, it grew into a mighty river, becoming wider and deeper the farther it flowed. Something similar happens with the blessings that flow from the temple as individuals are sealed as families. Meaningful growth occurs going backward and forward through the generations as sealing ordinances weld families together. </p>
<p> "Second, the river renewed everything that it touched. The blessings of the temple likewise have a stunning capacity to heal. Temple blessings can heal hearts and lives and families" ("Family History and Temple Work: Sealing and Healing," Ensign or Liahona, May 2018, 47&#8211;48; see also the video "And the River Will Grow," ChurchofJesusChrist.org). </p>

<p> To begin a discussion about how Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego showed faith in the Lord, you could ask a few class members to summarize the challenges these four men faced, described in Daniel 1, 3, and 6. Why would it have been hard to be faithful in these situations? What situations do we face that challenge our faith? Class members could search Daniel 1:10&#8211;13; 3:15&#8211;18; 6:10, looking for how these four men responded to their challenges. How can their examples help us in our efforts to be faithful disciples of Jesus Christ? </p>
<graphics-caption> Illustration of Daniel and his friends refusing the king's food, by Brian Call </graphics-caption>
<p> Many of us, like Daniel and his friends, have felt pressure to compromise our standards. What are some of the sources of this pressure in our lives? To help class members learn from the example of Daniel and his friends, you could divide the class into three groups and assign each group to review one of the following chapters: Daniel 1, 3, or 6. How did the Lord bless Daniel, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego when they chose to be faithful despite the pressure they faced? Each group could share with the class what they discovered. Class members could then counsel together about how to stay faithful despite social pressure or other kinds of pressure. They could also discuss the importance of seeking good friends who will support us in our standards. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> DANIEL 2 </subheading>

<p> Discussing Daniel 2 could help your class understand how The Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints is fulfilling its destiny as the prophesied stone "cut out of the mountain" (verse 45). To begin, you could review as a class Daniel's description and interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream, found in Daniel 2:31&#8211;45. Then you could show a picture of a stone (or draw one on the board). Invite class members to share what they learn about the kingdom of God by comparing it to the descriptions of the stone in Daniel 2:34&#8211;35, 44&#8211;45. Perhaps class members might know some of the history of the Church in your area that they can share. How have we seen Daniel's prophecies fulfilled in our individual lives? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> DANIEL 2:1&#8211;30 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Receiving revelation requires spiritual preparation. </subheading>
<p> Perhaps class members would benefit from learning about how Daniel prepared himself to receive the revelation needed to describe and interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream. You could begin by asking class members to review Daniel 2:1&#8211;15 and then share how they would feel if they found themselves in Daniel's position. Invite them to search Daniel 2:16&#8211;18 to learn what Daniel did. What do we learn from Daniel 1:17 about how God prepared Daniel? What can we learn from Daniel that can help us as we seek personal revelation? What can we learn from Daniel's words and actions after he received the Lord's help? (see Daniel 2:20&#8211;30). </p>

You could invite class members to summarize the challenge Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego faced (see Daniel 3:1&#8211;12) and then discuss how they responded (see Daniel 3:13&#8211;18). What do we learn about faith from the response of these men? You could write on the board the phrases Our God is able to . . . and But if not. . . from verses 17&#8211;18. Class members could suggest how they might fill in the blanks with situations they might face. For example, they might suggest "Our God is able to answer all my questions" and "But if not, I will patiently trust Him."

<p> You might begin a discussion of Hosea 1&#8211;3 by writing <i> marriage </i> on the board and asking class members to list words that they associate with marriage. How is making a covenant with the Lord like entering into a marriage? How is breaking that covenant like being unfaithful to a spouse? (see Hosea 2:5&#8211;7, 13). Then the class could talk about how the relationship between Hosea and Gomer symbolizes the relationship between the Lord and His people. What do Hosea 2:14&#8211;23 and Hosea 14 teach us about the Lord's love and mercy? How do we show the Lord our love and loyalty to Him? </p>
<p> Hosea 14 describes many beautiful promises the Lord made to the house of Israel if they would return to Him. Perhaps class members could search this chapter looking for these promises. What did the Lord say He would do? What might the phrase "love them freely" mean? (verse 4). What do the plant metaphors in verses 5&#8211;8 teach us about the Lord's blessings to us, including the blessings of repentance? </p>

<p> Hosea 6:6 and Joel 2:12&#8211;13 refer to animal sacrifice and tearing clothing as signs of remorse. While such practices may be unfamiliar today, these verses can lead to a discussion about what is most important to the Lord. You might read together Hosea 6:6 and discuss what this verse might mean. Invite some class members to read Matthew 9:10&#8211;13 and others to read Matthew 12:1&#8211;8. Then class members could teach each other how these events in the Savior's ministry help us understand the principle taught in Hosea 6:6. How can we live this principle in our day? </p>
<p> You could also read together Joel 2:12&#8211;13 and discuss what it might mean to rend our hearts and not just our garments. What do we learn from these verses about what it means to be true disciples of Jesus Christ? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> JOEL 2 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh." </subheading>
<p> To begin a discussion of Joel 2, you could share with the class what Moroni said about this prophecy when he visited Joseph Smith in 1823 (see Joseph Smith &#8212; History 1:41). Class members could share how they feel the prophecies in Joel 2:28&#8211;32 are being fulfilled in our day. You could also discuss how Elder David A. Bednar's words in "Additional Resources" relate to Joel's prophecy. Class members might discuss what it means to them to feel an outpouring of the Holy Ghost in their daily life. What can we do if we feel like we aren't receiving that outpouring? How can we help "[our] sons and [our] daughters" receive it? (verse 28). </p>

But we talk about it and we treat it as if hearing the voice of the Lord through His Spirit is the rare event. . . . [The Spirit] ought to be with us all of the time. Not every nanosecond, but if a person is doing his or her best &#8212; you don't have to be perfect &#8212; but if you and I are doing our best and we're not committing serious transgression, then we can count on the Holy Ghost guiding us. . . . </p>
<p> ". . . We seem to believe that the Holy Ghost is dramatic and big and sudden, when it's still and small and incremental over time.

How had the Israelites turned away from the Lord? (see, for example, Amos 2:6&#8211;8; 5:11&#8211;12). Why is it helpful to know about their downfall? Class members could then read Amos 8:11&#8211;12 and talk about why "famine" and "thirst" are good words to describe the condition of those who turn away from the Lord. Class members could also search Amos 5 for verses that can help us avoid apostasy in our lives (see, for example, verses 4, 11&#8211;12, 14&#8211;15, 25&#8211;26). </p>
<p type="bullet"> Understanding the spiritual hunger that accompanies apostasy helps us understand the spiritual feast we enjoy because of the Restoration.

<p> ". . . Our Heavenly Father loves all of His children, and He wants them all to have the blessings of the gospel in their lives. Spiritual light is not lost because God turns His back on His children. Rather, spiritual darkness results when His children turn their collective backs on Him. It is a natural consequence of bad choices made by individuals, communities, countries, and entire civilizations. This has been proven again and again throughout the course of time.

You could write a question like this on the board: <i> What can God's mercy, as demonstrated in Jonah 1&#8211;4, teach me about being more merciful? </i> Each class member could choose a chapter to review and look for answers to the question.

I still am amazed at the power she was granted, I believe from the Lord, to turn me around with so few words. As I remember them, they were: 'Oh, I suppose you <i> could </i> do that. But the <i> choice </i> is yours.' The only warning was in the emphasis she put on the words <i> could </i> and <i> choice </i> . Yet that was enough for me. </p>
<p> "Her power to warn with so few words sprang from three things I knew about her. First, I knew she loved me. Second, I knew she had already done what she wanted me to do and been blessed by it.

<p> There will be times in our lives when even our best spiritual effort and earnest, pleading prayers do not yield the victories for which we have yearned, whether that be regarding the large global matters or the small personal ones. So while we work and wait together for the answers to some of our prayers, I offer you my apostolic promise that they are heard and they are answered, though perhaps not at the time or in the way we wanted. But they are <i> always </i> answered at the time and in the way an omniscient and eternally compassionate parent should answer in Zion. </p>
<p> ". . . Faith means trusting God in good times and bad, even if that includes some suffering until we see His arm revealed in our behalf" ("Waiting on the Lord," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2020, 115&#8211;16). </p>

<p> <b> Ask open-ended questions. </b> When asking class members about their experiences with the scriptures, "let them know that you aren't looking for a specific answer but that you are sincerely interested in what they are learning" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 29). For some examples of open-ended questions, see <i> Teaching in the Savior's Way, </i> 31&#8211;32. </p>

<heading type="title"> "HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD" </heading>
<p> As you study Haggai and Zechariah, ponder how you can help class members find meaning in these prophecies. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Class members could share verses from Haggai and Zechariah that they pondered or discussed with others this week and discuss how these verses helped them draw closer to the Lord. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> HAGGAI 1; 2:1&#8211;9 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Consider your ways." </subheading>
<p> The counsel in Haggai 1 can help class members think about their priorities. You could invite them to read Haggai 1:1&#8211;7 and identify how the people in Jerusalem were failing to prioritize what the Lord wanted them to do. What are some things the Lord has asked us to make high priorities in our lives? What can distract us from focusing on Heavenly Father and the Savior and Their priorities? Perhaps class members could share experiences that have helped them "consider [their] ways" and their priorities. </p>
<p> To help class members think about how they can focus more completely on the Lord's priorities, you could ask them to review Haggai 2:1&#8211;9. What counsel did the Lord give that can help us do His work? Class members could share how they are able to put the Lord's priorities first in their lives as they deal with their many other important responsibilities. What does Haggai 2:1&#8211;9 teach about how the Lord blesses us when we put Him first in our lives? (see also "Additional Resources"). Give class members time to write down what they feel inspired to do because of this discussion. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ZECHARIAH 1&#8211;3; 7&#8211;8; 14 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord can make us holy. </subheading>
<p> To begin a discussion about holiness, you could read together Zechariah 14:20&#8211;21. Class members could share what the phrase "Holiness unto the Lord" means to them. What influence might it have on people if they saw the phrase "Holiness unto the Lord" inscribed on everyday objects? How does this phrase affect us when we see it on temples today? Class members could then read Zechariah 1:1&#8211;6; 3:1&#8211;7; 7:8&#8211;10; 8:16&#8211;17 and discuss what they learn about what it means to be holy. Why is our personal holiness important to the Lord? How does He help us become holy? </p>
<p> Class members could review Zechariah 2:10&#8211;11; 8:1&#8211;8; 14:9&#8211;11, 20&#8211;21 and share their impressions about what it would be like to live with the Savior in a state of holiness. How does the Lord prepare us to live in the conditions Zechariah described? How can we access His power to help us become more holy? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ZECHARIAH 9:9&#8211;11; 11:12&#8211;13; 12:10; 13:6&#8211;7 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Jesus Christ is the promised Messiah. </subheading>
<p> To help class members see connections between Zechariah's words and the Savior's life, as the people in Jesus's time did, you might divide the class into two groups. Give class members in the first group one of these passages: Zechariah 9:9&#8211;11; 11:12&#8211;13; 12:10; 13:6&#8211;7. Give class members in the other group one of these passages: Matthew 21:1&#8211;11; 26:14&#8211;16; 26:31; John 19:37. Each class member could try to find someone from the other group who has a scripture passage that matches theirs. What do we learn about the Savior from these verses? </p>
<p> To help class members ponder Zechariah 9:9&#8211;11, you might show a picture of the Savior's triumphal entry into Jerusalem (see this week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> ). Or you could show the video "The Lord's Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Class members could discuss what it might have felt like to be among the people welcoming Jesus into the city. How do we welcome Him into our lives, our homes, and our communities? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "Consider your ways." </subheading>
<p> After quoting Haggai 1:4&#8211;7, Elder Terence M. Vinson taught: </p>
<p> "We can feel enduring joy when our Savior and His gospel become the framework around which we build our lives. However, it's so easy for that framework to become, instead, the things of the world, where the gospel sits as an optional extra or as simply attending church for two hours on Sundays. When this is the case, it is tantamount to putting wages into 'a bag with holes.' </p>
<p> "Haggai is telling us to be committed. . . . </p>
<p> "There is no treasure, nor any hobby, nor any status, nor any social media, nor any video games, nor any sport, nor any association with a celebrity, nor anything on earth that is more precious than eternal life. So the Lord's counsel to every person is consider your ways"" ("True Disciples of the Savior," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2019, 9, 11). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Listen. </b> Listening is an act of love. One way to listen effectively is to look at the person who is speaking. This allows you to notice any nonverbal communication. (See Teaching in the Savior's Way, 34.) </p>

<heading type="ref"> Malachi </heading>
<heading type="title"> "I HAVE LOVED YOU, SAITH THE LORD" </heading>
<p> Some messages in Malachi may be especially important for your class to learn. As you study, pray to discern what those messages might be. Doing this will also help you feel the love that the Lord has for those you teach. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> You might begin a discussion about the book of Malachi by writing the word <i> Message </i> on the board. Encourage class members to share important messages that they found in each chapter of Malachi. To help class members remember and ponder what is shared, you could write those messages on the board. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="ref"> MALACHI 1:6&#8211;14 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord asks for "a pure offering." </subheading>
<p> To encourage class members to share what they learned about offerings from Malachi 1:6&#8211;14, you could invite them to review these verses silently and discuss with another class member something that the Israelite priests did not understand about offerings. Why does the Lord ask for the best from us? Class members could make a list of offerings, or sacrifices, that we make to the Lord today. For each item on the list, they could discuss what might make it a "polluted" offering or a "pure" offering (Malachi 1:7, 11). </p>
<subheading type="ref"> MALACHI 3&#8211;4 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Malachi's prophecies are being fulfilled in the latter days. </subheading>
<p> You could begin a discussion about Malachi 3&#8211;4 by pointing out that Moroni shared verses from these chapters when he appeared to Joseph Smith (see Joseph Smith &#8212; History 1:36&#8211;39). What truths in these chapters do class members feel might have been especially important for Joseph &#8212; and us &#8212; to know? Class members could get into small groups and list as many truths as they can. Encourage groups to share their lists and discuss why these truths are important in the latter days. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> MALACHI 3:8&#8211;12 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> The Lord opens the windows of heaven when we pay our tithing. </subheading>
<p> To encourage class members to share their testimonies of the law of tithing, you could invite them to find principles in Malachi 3:8&#8211;12 and to share how they came to know these principles are true. They could talk about how the Lord has blessed them &#8212; spiritually and temporally &#8212; for paying tithing. Or they could discuss lessons about tithing that Elder David A. Bednar shared in his message "The Windows of Heaven" (Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 17&#8211;20) and share what they have learned as they have strived to live this law. </p>
<p> Ask class members to read Malachi 3:8&#8211;12 silently while pondering how they might teach someone why the Lord asks us to pay tithing. They could also read the statement by President Gordon B. Hinckley in "Additional Resources." What would we want others to understand about tithing? For example, what does it mean to pay tithing? Why does the Lord want us to do it? How are the "windows of heaven" (verse 10) opened when we pay tithing? What concerns might someone have about paying tithing, and how would we respond? Ask class members to share how keeping this commandment has strengthened their faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. </p>
<subheading type="ref"> MALACHI 4:5&#8211;6 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "I will send you Elijah the prophet." </subheading>
<p> Class members might gain helpful insights about Malachi 4:5&#8211;6 by comparing these verses to the way Moroni quoted them to Joseph Smith in Joseph Smith &#8212; History 1:38&#8211;39. (It might help to have someone write each version side by side on the board.) What does Moroni's wording add to our understanding of the verses in Malachi? You might also discuss questions like these: Who are "the fathers"? (see Deuteronomy 29:13). How do our hearts turn to our fathers, and how do their hearts turn to us? To help your class understand how Malachi's prophecy was fulfilled, they could read about when Elijah committed the sealing keys to Joseph Smith (see Doctrine and Covenants 110:13&#8211;16). Why are class members grateful these keys have been restored? </p>
<p> Malachi 4:5&#8211;6 provides a great opportunity to talk about temple and family history work. Perhaps class members could share experiences they have had while doing this work and how those experiences have helped them turn their hearts to their fathers. What can we do to help future generations turn their hearts toward us? </p>

<subheading type="sub-title"> Tithing is a matter of faith. </subheading>
<p> President Gordon B. Hinckley said, "We <i> can </i> pay our tithing. This is not so much a matter of money as it is a matter of faith. I have yet to find a faithful tithe payer who cannot testify that in a very literal and wonderful way the windows of heaven have been opened and blessings have been poured out upon him or her" ("Let Us Move This Work Forward, "Ensign, Nov. 1985, 85). </p>

<heading type="title"> "WE HAVE WAITED FOR HIM, AND HE WILL SAVE US" </heading>
<p> During your personal study and preparation to teach, consider how you can help class members feel the resounding joy of the Savior's birth. Invite the Spirit to testify to them of Jesus Christ's redeeming love. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Invite Sharing </heading>
<p> Christmastime might be a good opportunity to invite class members to share how studying the Old Testament has strengthened their faith in Jesus Christ. </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Teach the Doctrine </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> We rejoice in our Redeemer. </subheading>
<p> Even though Christmas is known as a season of joy, there are many whose circumstances make it hard to find joy, even during this time of year. An important message of Christmas is that the Savior can ease our burdens and help us find peace and even joy. To share this message, you could write on the board the following scripture references: Psalm 35:9; Isaiah 25:8&#8211;9; 44:21&#8211;24; 51:11; Zephaniah 3:14&#8211;20; Moses 5:5&#8211;11. Then you could write on the board a question for class members to ponder as they read the passages, like <i> What reasons do these scripture passages give to be joyful? </i> Ask them to share what they find. Perhaps you could also give class members time to write about their own joy in the Savior. They might find additional insights from President Russell M. Nelson's message in "Additional Resources." </p>
<p> Christmas provides opportunities to spread the joy of Christ by serving others. Ahead of class, you might invite a class member to review Elder Ulisses Soares's message "A Modern Angelic Host" (First Presidency Christmas devotional, Dec. 8, 2019, broadcasts.ChurchofJesusChrist.org) and come prepared to share how an act of service helped Elder Soares and his family feel the joy of Christmas. You could also share portions of his message in class. Class members could share their own experiences of giving or receiving acts of service at Christmastime. How can we act on Elder Soares's invitation to follow the Savior's "perfect example of love and goodwill toward men"? </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Symbols can help us remember Jesus Christ. </subheading>
<p> This week's outline in <i> Come, Follow Me&#8212;For Individuals and Families </i> lists some symbols in the Old Testament that teach about Jesus Christ. Class members could share what they learned about the Savior from these and other symbols they found in their study. What have we learned about finding the Savior in the scriptures? What experiences have taught us that "all things are created and made to bear record of [Him]"? (Moses 6:63). </p>
<subheading type="sub-title"> God gave us the gift of His Son. </subheading>
<p> Gift giving is a Christmas tradition in most cultures. You could lead a discussion with class members about the gifts God has given us, especially the gift of His Son, Jesus Christ. To do this, you could share the video "He Is the Gift" (ChurchofJesusChrist.org) and invite class members to share what the gift of the Savior means to them. How can we show Heavenly Father our gratitude for this gift? </p>
<subheading type="ref"> ISAIAH 7:14; 9:6 </subheading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> "His name shall be called Wonderful." </subheading>
<p> The prophet Isaiah used many names and titles to describe the Messiah, who would be born in Bethlehem (see for example, Isaiah 7:14; 9:6). Perhaps class members would enjoy learning more about the Savior and His mission by learning about these titles. They could pick a title and find other scripture passages that help them understand what it means. For example, they might learn more about the title "Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6) by reading Psalm 85:8; Isaiah 52:7; Luke 2:14; or John 16:33. To help class members find other scriptures, suggest that they look in Guide to the Scriptures (scriptures.ChurchofJesusChrist.org). What do these titles suggest about the Savior and what He does for us? </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Additional Resources </heading>
<subheading type="sub-title"> Jesus Christ offers peace and joy. </subheading>
<p> President Russell M. Nelson taught: </p>
<p> "When the focus of our lives is on God's plan of salvation. . . and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening &#8212; or not happening &#8212; in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him. He is the source of all joy. We feel it at Christmastime when we sing, 'Joy to the world, the Lord is come' [Hymns, no. 201]. And we can feel it all year round. For latter-day Saints, Jesus Christ is joy!. . . </p>
<p> "Just as the Savior offers peace that 'passeth all understanding' [Philippians 4:7], He also offers an intensity, depth, and breadth of joy that defy human logic or mortal comprehension" ("Joy and Spiritual Survival," Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2016, 82). </p>
<heading type="section-title"> Improving Our Teaching </heading>
<p> <b> Prepare with people in mind. </b> "Let your understanding of the people you teach guide your plans. . . . Christlike teachers are not committed to a particular style or method; they are committed to helping people build faith in Jesus Christ" (Teaching in the Savior's Way, 7). </p>
